# Session 06: Final Testing & Documentation

**Session ID**: `phase03-session06-final-testing-documentation`
**Status**: Not Started
**Estimated Tasks**: ~20-25
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours

---

## Objective

Achieve >90% test coverage across the vessel system, complete all documentation, and perform final validation for production readiness.

---

## Scope

### In Scope (MVP)

- Audit current test coverage and identify gaps
- Write additional unit tests to reach >90% coverage
- Integration tests for complete vessel workflows
- Stress testing at 500 concurrent vessels
- Memory profiling and leak verification
- Update VESSEL_SYSTEM.md documentation
- Update TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION_MASTER_INDEX.md
- Update PRD with final status
- Create troubleshooting guide additions
- Final Valgrind clean verification
- Performance benchmark documentation

### Out of Scope

- New feature implementation
- Performance optimization beyond documentation
- User manual/player documentation

---
