## Flavor Text / Description

### DragonLance Theme

*"The Knights of Solamnia stand as the shining example of honor, courage, and wisdom in all of Krynn. Founded on the virtues established by Vinas Solamnus, these knights follow the Oath and the Measure, a complex code of conduct that guides their every action.*

*Beginning as Knights of the Crown, they learn Loyalty and Obedience - the foundation of all virtue. The Crown Knights form the martial backbone of the order, disciplined warriors who protect the innocent through strength of arms.*

*Advancing to the order of the Sword, they embrace Courage and Faith, becoming warrior-clerics who channel divine power to smite evil and inspire their comrades. The Sword Knights are crusaders and knights errant, bringing light to the darkest corners of the world.*

*The greatest among them rise to the Order of the Rose, embodying Wisdom and Justice. Rose Knights are the leaders and lawgivers of the Knighthood, inspiring others through word and deed, guiding all on the path of honor.*

*The three orders united represent the complete knight - strong, faithful, and wise. To become a Grand Master is to achieve the perfection of knighthood itself, becoming Knighthood's Flower - the ultimate expression of virtue.*

*Patron Deities: Habbakuk (Crown - Loyalty), Kiri-Jolith (Sword - Courage), Paladine (Rose - Wisdom)"*

---

### LuminariMUD Theme (Alternative)

*"The Knights of Solamnia represent the evolution of knightly virtue through three sacred paths, each building upon the last to create the ultimate warrior-leader.*

*The Crimson Loom knights weave oaths into reality, their spoken vows becoming literal threads that bind them to duty. Each oath fulfilled strengthens them; each broken promise becomes a wound that never heals.*

*Rising to the Sundered Dawn, they undergo a soul-splitting ritual where half their essence is blessed by light, half cursed by shadow. These warrior-mystics walk between extremes, channeling divine power through their duality.*

*The greatest achieve the Ember Throne, becoming warrior-artists who channel divine fire through creative expression. They forge heroes from the weak, beauty from destruction, and hope from ash.*

*Together, these paths create knights who are unshakeable in loyalty, fearless in battle, and inspiring in leadership - living legends who sacrifice everything for the ideals they embody.*

*Divine Patrons: Kordran & Aethyra (Oaths/Duty), Seraphine & Nyxara (Light/Shadow), Pyrion & Calystral & Borhild (Fire/Passion/Craft)"*
