# LuminariMUD PHP Tools - Security Audit Report & Deployment Guide

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive security audit report and deployment guide for the LuminariMUD PHP tools. These tools have been thoroughly audited and improved to meet modern security standards.

**Current Status**: All PHP tools have been relocated to the `util/` directory and updated with proper documentation references. Internal paths have been adjusted to maintain functionality.

## PHP Tools Overview

All PHP tools are now located in the `util/` directory for better organization.

### Main Tools

1. **util/bonus_breakdown.php** - Item bonus analysis tool (wear slot breakdown)
2. **util/bonuses.php** - Item bonus cross-reference matrix tool
3. **util/enter_encounter.php** - Random encounter generator tool
4. **util/enter_hunt.php** - Hunt system creator tool
5. **util/enter_spell_help.php** - Spell/power help file generator

### Supporting Files

6. **util/config.php** - Shared configuration and security utilities
7. **util/autoload.php** - PSR-4 compliant autoloader for PHP classes

### Accessing the Tools

When deployed on a web server, the tools can be accessed at:
- `/util/bonus_breakdown.php` - Item bonus analysis by wear slot
- `/util/bonuses.php` - Item bonus cross-reference matrix
- `/util/enter_encounter.php` - Create new random encounters
- `/util/enter_hunt.php` - Create new hunt mobs
- `/util/enter_spell_help.php` - Generate spell/power help entries

   - Memory usage improvements

## Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.4 or higher (PHP 8.1+ recommended)
- MySQL 5.7 or higher
- Web server (Apache/Nginx) with HTTPS enabled
- Composer (for dependency management)

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to PHP Tools Directory**
   ```bash
   cd util/
   ```

2. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment configuration (if using .env)
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your actual configuration
   nano .env
   ```

2. **Database Configuration**
   ```sql
   -- Create database user with limited privileges
   CREATE USER 'luminari_tools'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secure_password';
   GRANT SELECT ON luminari_db.* TO 'luminari_tools'@'localhost';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

3. **File Permissions**
   ```bash
   # Set proper file permissions (from util/ directory)
   chmod 644 *.php
   chmod 600 .env
   # Create and set permissions for cache/logs if needed
   mkdir -p cache logs
   chmod 755 cache/
   chmod 755 logs/
   ```

4. **Web Server Configuration**
   
   **Apache (.htaccess in util/ directory)**
   ```apache
   # Deny access to sensitive files
   <Files ".env">
       Require all denied
   </Files>
   
   <Files "config.php">
       Require all denied
   </Files>
   
   <Files "autoload.php">
       Require all denied
   </Files>
   
   # Force HTTPS
   RewriteEngine On
   RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
   RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]
   ```

   **Nginx**
   ```nginx
   # Deny access to sensitive files in util/ directory
   location ~ /util/\.(env|git) {
       deny all;
   }
   
   location ~ /util/(config|autoload)\.php$ {
       deny all;
   }
   
   # Force HTTPS
   if ($scheme != "https") {
       return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
   }
   ```

### Security Configuration

1. **Authentication Setup**
   - Implement proper user authentication system
   - Configure role-based access control
   - Set up session management

2. **Database Security**
   - Use dedicated database user with minimal privileges
   - Enable MySQL SSL connections
   - Regular security updates

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Configure error logging
   - Set up access logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activity

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Change Default Credentials**
   - Update all default passwords
   - Generate secure API keys
   - Configure proper authentication

2. **Enable Authentication**
   - Authentication checks are present but may need to be activated
   - The tools check for $_SESSION['authenticated'] and role-based access
   - Implement a user management system to set these session variables
   - Configure role-based access (developer, content_creator, admin, data_analyst)

3. **SSL/TLS Configuration**
   - Ensure HTTPS is properly configured
   - Use strong SSL/TLS ciphers
   - Implement HSTS headers

### Ongoing Security Practices

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Keep PHP and dependencies updated
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Apply security patches promptly

2. **Access Control**
   - Limit access to authorized personnel only
   - Use VPN or IP restrictions if possible
   - Regular access reviews

3. **Backup & Recovery**
   - Regular database backups
   - Test backup restoration procedures
   - Secure backup storage
