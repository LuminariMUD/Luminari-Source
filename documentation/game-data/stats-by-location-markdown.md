## Design Notes

1. **Stat Distribution Philosophy**: 
   - Jewelry slots (FINGER, NECK, WRIST) have the most stat options
   - Armor pieces (HEAD, BODY, ARMS, LEGS) are enhancement-only
   - Weapons and held items vary in their stat availability

2. **Balance Considerations**:
   - Each primary attribute appears on only 1-2 slot types
   - Resistances are distributed across multiple slots to encourage equipment diversity
   - Critical stats like Hit Points are limited to specific slots

3. **Equipment Strategy**:
   - Players must carefully choose equipment combinations to maximize desired stats
   - No single slot provides all resistances or attributes
   - Enhancement-only slots focus on base armor/weapon improvements
