This directory contains documentation on various aspects of the game.

Area builders will be most interested in database.doc, dbsup.doc, defs.doc,
shop.doc, and values.doc.  These five files can be mailed automatically
with the "do_mail" script in this directory.  do_mail takes the recipient
as its only command-line argument.  For example, to mail the documentation
to CircleMUD's author, you'd type "do_mail jelson@cs.jhu.edu".
