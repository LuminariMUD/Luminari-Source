PC's  ~ Players
NPC's ~ Non Players (Monsters)
<name> is used for short names
[x..y] is used to indicate min and max


PC's level [0..20], level [21..24] is special, not useable in gameplay.
NPC's level [0..30]

All PC's and NPC's have following abilities <ABIL>:

  Strength     <STR>
    <PC>  [3..18/100]
    <NPC> [0..25]

  Dexterity    <DEX>
    <PC>  [3..18]
    <NPC> [0..25]

  Intelligence <INT>
    <PC>  [3..18]
    <NPC> [0..25]

  Wisdom       <WIS>
    <PC>  [3..18]
    <NPC> [0..25]

  Constitution <CON>
    <PC>  [3..18]
    <NPC> [0..25]



All PC's must select one of four classes :

  Magic User <MU>
  Cleric     <CL>
  Thief      <TH>       
  Warrior    <WA>


Every PC class have a Primary ability (requisite) <PR> :

  <MU> <INT>
  <CL> <WIS>
  <TH> <DEX>
  <WA> <STR>


When creating a new <PC>, the <PC>'s <ABIL> are calculated as:

   NOTE: This is when being raised from level 0 to level 1!

   The size of the <ABIL> dice, is determined by rolling 4 1d6 dice,
   and adding the sum of the three largest dice.
   The <ABIL> is sorted and assigned a <PC> in descending order,
   depending on the class.

   <MU> == <INT> <WIS> <DEX> <STR> <CON>
   <CL> == <WIS> <INT> <STR> <DEX> <CON>
   <TH> == <DEX> <STR> <CON> <INT> <WIS>
   <WA> == <STR> <DEX> <CON> <WIS> <INT>


   <HP>   base is set as 10
   <MANA> is allways set to 100
   Set level as 1
   Set exp as 1
   Set theives abilities as basic.

   Call the "Advance Level" routines!


Hitpoints:
  <HP> ~ Hitpoints

  <PC>'s gain in the following range when advancing a level.
    <WA> [10..15]  Average (12.5)
    <TH> [7..13]   Average (10.0)
    <CL> [5..10]   Average  (7.5)
    <MA> [3..8]    Average  (5.5)


Advancing a level (<PC>'s only):
        <HP> is gained as above
        "Spells to learn" is increased by
          MIN(1, WIS_APPLY) for <WA> & <TH>
        else
          MIN(2, WIS_APPLY) for <MU> & <CL>

<NPC> <ABIL> follow <PC>'s <ABIL> up to level 20, with the
  exception that NPC may have 0 in abilities. Only unusual
  <NPC>'s are assigned abilities.

  <PR> may be in 18/00..100 for Warriors ONLY!

      
============================= MONSTER LOOKUP ==============================

This is general guidelines for creating monsters. This is when creating
"S"impel monsters. Detailed monsters require a great deal of care when
designing, and it is not really worth it.

The idea is that a X level fighter is equal to about a X level monster!
This implies that the <THAC0> ought to decrease by one every level
(starting at '20' on level 1 - minimum is '1' from level 20+). The damage
given by a monster is also important - average weapon damage is at the
moment 1d8.

------------------------------ GUIDELINES ---------------------------------

MAGICAL ITEMS:
--------------

In DikuMud it is possible to create all kinds of Magic items - but to avoid
chaos (having 1st levels kill 20 level dragons) these rules for Magic must
be obeyed.

It is possible to create almost any item. Items can (example) change the
<STR>, <DEX>, <WIS>, <INT>, <CON>, <HP>, Age, Weight, Height, XP,
etc. None of these changes are directly permanent in effetct, but may be
so indirectly - example:

  Iggy found a helmet of Increase Wisdom/Intelligence (some + modifier).
  When Iggy wears this helmet - these abilities improve, when he removes
  the helmet they return to their original state. Thus no direct change
  has happened.  BUT if Iggy practices spells (upon which INT and WIS
  determines the rate & success) he will learn them much faster than
  normal.  This was an example of an indirect change.


Good ideas when making Magic Items:

NEVER use large modifiers, exceptional items should modify at most by +3.
  This includes, swords, armours, ability changes.

Impose a penalty on the Item - for example make a helmet of wisdom may
  at the same time reduce the constitution. Or maybe a ring of masochism -
  when you wear it your MAX-HITPOINT increase by +200, when you remove it
  they disappear again.  The ring likes to remove itself from the finger.

MONSTER CLASSIFICATIONS:

Major Demon  == Balrog/etc.
Demon Lords  == Orcus/etc.
Demi Gods    == ??
Lesser Gods  == Heimdal/Sif/etc.
Greater Gods == Thor/Odin/etc.
Arch Devil   == Asmodeus/etc.

When creating monsters pay attention to the table above.

       CHARACTER & MONSTER ARMOR:

<AC> range from [10..-10] this is what it means :

AC  10 = Naked person
AC   0 = Very heavily armoured person (Full plate mail at *all* body parts)
AC -10 = Armored Tank (Hopefully impossible for players)

           IMPORTANT NOTICE

Rare items may only exist in minimal quantities!
Especially you should limit the occurence of
magical protection, since it is easy to carry.

============================================================================

Weapons & Carrying capacity
---------------------------

The weight of a weapon determines the strength needed to wield the weapon,
these values should be used:

===========================================================================
Notes:

<THAC0> this is the number needed to roll on a 20-sided dice to hit
        opponent <AC> equivalent of zero. A 20 is always considered
        a hit, a 1 is always a miss. Example:

          Your <THAC0> is 14 (ei. level 7 fighter). You are fighting
          an opponent with <AC> '3'. Thus to hit <AC> 0 you must
          roll a 14 or greater. To hit <AC> 3 you must then roll
          11 (14-3) or greater. If you had to hit <AC> '-3' you
          would have to roll 17 (14-(-3)) or greater on a 20 sided
          dice.
