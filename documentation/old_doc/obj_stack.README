This is an updated object stacking function for bpl 21/22.

The original was done by Brian Willaims <bmw@efn.org>, I merely updated it
slightly.  As is, you merely drop the function in act.informative.c
replacing your old list_obj_to_char.

Items will then appear as:
( 2) a corroded pipe is lying here
( 4) a piece of moldy cheese has been left on the ground here

That is all there is to it!
