                 OFFENSIVE SPELL AVERAGE DAMAGE CHARTS


Upon learning a new spell, the manauser will always be able to cast
two of these spells. For each level, the manauser will be abel to cast
one additional spell of the type learned. The maximum abel to learn is
different between each spell, but for most offensive spells it is 7.
The number of spells that can be cast assume that everybody has got
100 mana points.


General Idea:
  A M.U. Should be abel to kill a victim 3 levels below himself, by
  using all his MANA points for offensive spells. This include
  saving_throw calculations.


Saving throw has effect (level of victim = L, damage of spell = D)

   Actual_Average_Damage = (L/20*(D/2))+(((20-L)/20)*D)
     where L in [1..18] (Means saving never better than 2)

   If you want to know how much dam, say E, a L level victim,
   get from D dam, then:

   Effective_Dam (E) = D/(1-(L/40))


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TABLE:
     LVL is level of victim.
     HP  is hit_points.
     ERM is spell damage to effectively remove HPR
     SAV is assumed saving throw
     A.DIF. is Aprroximate adjusted difference.

Magic Users New Damage Table. The damage listed by each spell shows how
much damage can be given by using 100 mana points at the apropriate level.
To make it worth-while to learn new damaging spells, a spell which is 
"overlapped" by a new spell will give less damage than the exact calculated
average.
