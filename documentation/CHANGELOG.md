### Critical Bug Fixes

#### Fixed "(null)" Race Display in Character Creation
- **Issue**: New players saw "(null)" entries in race selection during character creation, severely impacting first impressions
- **Root Cause**: RACE_GOBLIN and RACE_HOBGOBLIN were only implemented in FR campaign section, not default campaign:
  - Race constants RACE_GOBLIN=26 and RACE_HOBGOBLIN=27 are defined in structs.h
  - But their add_race() implementations were only in the FR campaign section of race.c
  - Default campaign had no implementations for slots 26 & 27, showing as "(null)"
- **Solution**: Copied RACE_GOBLIN and RACE_HOBGOBLIN implementations to default campaign section
- **Files Modified**: race.c:3599-3689 (added Goblin and Hobgoblin race implementations for default campaign)
- **Impact**: Goblin and Hobgoblin races now properly display in default campaign character creation

#### Fixed Critical Double-Free Bug in objsave.c
- **Issue**: Server crash (SIGABRT) when loading house data, with corruption in free_tokens()
- **Root Cause**: The object parsing code in objsave.c was calling `free(*line)` to free individual token strings during parsing, but these strings belonged to the tokenize() array and were freed again by `free_tokens()` at the end, causing a double-free
- **Memory Corruption Pattern**:
  - During parsing, `free(*line)` freed the token strings
  - Memory allocator reused the freed memory for other allocations
  - New allocations wrote pointer values into the old string memory
  - When `free_tokens()` ran, it tried to free these corrupted pointers, causing crash
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all `free(*line)` calls in parsing loops (lines 2416, 3352, 3976, etc.)
  - Added comments explaining that token strings must not be freed individually
  - Only `free_tokens()` should be called at the end to properly clean up the entire array
- **Files Modified**: 
  - objsave.c: Multiple locations where `free(*line)` was removed
- **Impact**: Eliminates crashes when loading house data, particularly house #24828 which triggered the bug consistently

#### Fixed Critical Memory Allocation Failures in tokenize() Function
- **Issue**: Server crash (SIGABRT) when loading house data due to unchecked memory allocation failures
- **Root Cause**: The `tokenize()` function in mysql.c had no error handling for memory allocation failures:
  - `malloc()` at line 211 could return NULL
  - `realloc()` at lines 218 and 226 could return NULL and leak memory
  - `strdup()` at lines 208 and 220 could return NULL
  - When any allocation failed, NULL or invalid pointers were stored in the array, causing crashes in `free_tokens()`
- **Solution**: 
  - Added comprehensive NULL checks after every memory allocation
  - Implemented proper cleanup on allocation failures to prevent memory leaks
  - Return NULL on error to allow graceful error handling by callers
  - Added detailed error logging to help diagnose memory issues
- **Caller Updates**: Updated all tokenize() callers to handle NULL returns:
  - `objsave.c`: 3 locations (objsave_parse_objects_db, pet_load_objs, objsave_parse_objects_db_sheath)
  - `mud_event.c`: 1 location (event_countdown)
  - `mysql.c`: 3 locations (load_regions, load_paths, envelope)
- **Files Modified**: 
  - mysql.c:206-272 (tokenize function)
  - objsave.c:2126-2132, 3057-3062, 3673-3678
  - mud_event.c:583-587
  - mysql.c:368-375, 729-739, 943-948
- **Impact**: Prevents server crashes from memory allocation failures, provides graceful degradation under low memory conditions
- **Additional Fix**: Fixed C90 compatibility - declared all variables at beginning of blocks (no C99-style declarations)

#### Fixed Critical tokenize() NULL Termination Crash
- **Issue**: Server crash (SIGABRT) when loading house data during boot
- **Root Cause**: The `tokenize()` function in mysql.c:215-226 was improperly NULL-terminating arrays by incrementing count after adding NULL, causing `free_tokens()` to read uninitialized memory and attempt to free garbage pointers
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed loop from `while(1)` to `while(tok)` to only process valid tokens
  - Properly NULL-terminate array after loop without incrementing count
  - Ensure adequate space for NULL terminator with bounds checking
- **Files Modified**: mysql.c:215-229
- **Impact**: Eliminates deterministic crash during server boot when loading house #24828, restoring server stability

### Compiler Warning Fixes

#### Fixed All Remaining Compiler Warnings (32 warnings eliminated)
- **Format Truncation Warnings**:
  - `act.informative.c`: Increased buffer sizes for keyword1 (100→128) and dex_max (10→20)
  - `act.wizard.c`: Increased tmp_buf size from 1024 to 8192 to handle large format strings
  - `char_descs.c`: Increased final buffer from 256 to 512 to handle concatenated strings
  - `fight.c`: Increased buf size from 10 to 20 for integer formatting
  - `limits.c`: Increased buf size from 200 to 256 for spell name formatting
  - `roleplay.c`: Increased buf2 size from 100 to 200 for roleplay info formatting
  - `utils.c`: Increased temp_buf (200→256) and line_buf (200→256) for HP calculations
- **String Operation Warnings**:
  - `act.item.c`: Replaced strncat with memcpy to avoid compiler warning about length dependency
  - `ban.c`: Fixed strncpy truncation by reserving space for null terminator
  - `db.c`: Added null termination after strncpy in two locations (zone names and object descriptions)
  - `genolc.c` & `genwld.c`: Added null termination after strncpy for room descriptions
- **Address Comparison Warnings**:
  - `act.wizard.c`, `class.c`, `magic.c`, `spells.c`: Removed redundant NULL checks for array addresses (AFF_FLAGS)
  - `players.c`: Removed redundant NULL check for host array member
  - Arrays cannot be NULL by definition, making these checks unnecessary
- **Impact**: Clean compilation with zero warnings, improving code quality and maintainability

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Major Memory Leak in tokenize() Function (mysql.c)
- **Issue**: 318KB memory leak - the largest single memory leak identified in valgrind analysis
- **Root Cause**: In mysql.c, three locations were manually freeing individual tokens but not calling `free_tokens()` to properly free the token array itself
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced manual token cleanup loops with proper `free_tokens()` calls in:
    - `load_regions()` at line 337 (was lines 332-338)
    - `load_paths()` at line 691 (was lines 686-693)  
    - `envelope()` at line 900 (was lines 887-903)
- **Files Modified**: mysql.c:337, 691, 900
- **Impact**: Eliminates 318KB of memory leaks from database operations - the single largest memory leak fixed to date

#### Fixed Critical Use-After-Free in close_socket()
- **Issue**: Use-after-free bug causing segfaults during player disconnection
- **Root Cause**: In `comm.c:2951`, the code used `simple_list()` to iterate through descriptor events while calling `event_cancel()`, which freed the memory that the iterator was still referencing
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced unsafe `simple_list()` iteration with direct access to first item
  - New code safely gets events from the list head while the list size > 0
  - Prevents iterator from accessing freed memory
- **Files Modified**: comm.c:2951-2956
- **Impact**: Eliminates critical crashes during player disconnections, significantly improving server stability

## 2025-07-25

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Critical Memory Leaks in tokenize() Function Usage
- **Issue**: Most frequently occurring memory leak in valgrind analysis - tokenize() results not being freed
- **Root Cause**: The tokenize() function returns dynamically allocated arrays of strings, but several callers were not freeing the array itself (only the individual strings)
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `free_tokens()` helper function in mysql.c to properly free both strings and the array
  - Fixed memory leaks in:
    - objsave.c: Added `free_tokens(lines)` calls in objsave_parse_objects_db() (3 locations)
    - mud_event.c: Added `free_tokens(tokens)` in event_encounter_reset()
- **Files Modified**: 
  - mysql.c:232-248 (added free_tokens function)
  - mysql.h:29 (added free_tokens declaration)
  - objsave.c:2417, 3340, 3968 (added free_tokens calls)
  - mud_event.c:635 (added free_tokens call)
- **Impact**: Eliminates the most common memory leak pattern found in valgrind analysis (159KB+ from tokenize calls)

## 2025-01-27

### Bug Fixes

#### Fixed Major Memory Leak in Quest System (hlquest.c)
- **Issue**: 113KB memory leak in `clear_hlquest()` function during quest initialization
- **Root Cause**: Function allocated memory with `strdup()` for keywords and reply_msg fields that were immediately overwritten in `boot_the_quests()`
- **Solution**: Changed `clear_hlquest()` to initialize these pointers to NULL instead of allocating unused memory
- **Files Modified**: hlquest.c:768-769
- **Impact**: Eliminates 113KB of memory leaks during server boot (part of 460KB total identified leaks)

#### Fixed Quest Command Memory Leak in Mob Prototype Cleanup
- **Issue**: 15.7KB memory leak from quest_command structures allocated in `boot_the_quests()`
- **Root Cause**: `destroy_db()` was not freeing quest data attached to mob prototypes during shutdown
- **Solution**: Added `free_hlquest(&mob_proto[cnt])` to the mob prototype cleanup loop in db.c:853
- **Files Modified**: db.c:853 (in destroy_db function)
- **Impact**: Eliminates 15.7KB of memory leaks during server shutdown (part of 460KB total identified leaks)

#### Fixed Major Memory Leak in tokenize() Function
- **Issue**: 318KB memory leak in `tokenize()` function used for parsing database queries
- **Root Cause**: The dynamically allocated token array (char**) was never freed after use, only individual strings were freed
- **Solution**: Added `free(tokens)` after each tokenize usage in load_regions(), load_paths(), and envelope() functions
- **Files Modified**: mysql.c:320, 675, 885
- **Impact**: Eliminates 318KB of memory leaks during database operations (largest single leak, part of 460KB total identified leaks)

#### Fixed NULL Object Handling in fight.c
- **Issue**: `unequip_char()` could return NULL when called in corpse equipment transfer, causing crashes when passed to `obj_to_obj()`
- **Solution**: Added NULL check after `unequip_char()` before calling `obj_to_obj()` in fight.c:1791-1793
- **Impact**: Prevents crashes during death when equipment slots are empty or unequip fails

#### Fixed Extraction Counting Mismatch
- **Issue**: Direct call to `extract_char_final()` in act.wizard.c bypassed extraction counting mechanism
- **Root Cause**: `extractions_pending` counter only incremented in `extract_char()`, not in direct `extract_char_final()` calls
- **Solution**: Changed `extract_char_final(victim)` to `extract_char(victim)` in act.wizard.c:1450
- **Impact**: Eliminates "Couldn't find X extractions as counted" errors and ensures proper character cleanup

#### Resolved False "Missing Damage Types" Issue
- **Issue**: Task list incorrectly identified spell IDs 1507 and 1527 as missing damage type definitions
- **Investigation**: Found that these are psionic spell IDs:
  - 1507 = PSIONIC_ENERGY_RAY (defined in spells.h)
  - 1527 = PSIONIC_ENERGY_PUSH (defined in spells.h)
- **Resolution**: No code changes needed - these spells correctly use `GET_PSIONIC_ENERGY_TYPE(ch)` for damage
- **Impact**: Clarified that no damage types are missing; updated task list to reflect resolved status

- **Solution**: Added `extract_obj(temp)` cleanup calls before error returns at lines 476 and 485
- **Impact**: Prevents major memory leak during house saves when database errors occur
- **Source**: Identified via valgrind analysis (`valgrind_20250724_210758.log`)

#### Fixed Use-After-Free Bug in List Iterator System
- **Issue**: Use-after-free error in `lists.c:553` when removing items during iteration
- **Root Cause**: `simple_list()` iterator held stale pointers to freed items after `remove_from_list()`
- **Solution**: 
  - Added NULL pointer safety check in `next_in_list()` to prevent dereferencing freed memory
  - Refactored `free_list()` functions to use safe iteration pattern with cached next pointers
  - Prevents iterator from accessing freed memory by pre-caching next item before removal
- **Impact**: Eliminates crashes when lists are modified during iteration (common in cleanup operations)
- **Source**: Identified via valgrind analysis (`valgrind_20250724_210758.log`)
