### Critical Bugs

#### Player Death Crash (Memory Corruption)
**Priority: CRITICAL**
**Status: Additional Fix Attempt - Testing Required**

**Problem**: Game crashes during player death when `save_char()` tries to allocate memory with `calloc()`. The crash occurs in `malloc_consolidate()`, indicating heap corruption.

**Stack Trace Analysis**:
```
#0  malloc_consolidate() 
#1  _int_malloc()
#2  calloc()
#3  save_char(ch, mode=0) at players.c:1548
#4  raw_kill(ch, killer) at fight.c:2199
#5  die(ch, killer) at fight.c:2348
#6  dam_killed_vict(ch, victim) at fight.c:4826
#7  damage(...) at fight.c:5460
#8  handle_successful_attack(...) at fight.c:10574
#9  hit(...) at fight.c:11374
#10 perform_attacks(...) at fight.c:12238
#11 perform_violence(ch, phase=3) at fight.c:13052
#12 event_combat_round(event_obj) at fight.c:12548
#13 event_process() at dg_event.c:131
```

**Root Cause**: Race condition with combat events. A combat event continues processing AFTER the character has already died and started death processing.

**Sequence of Events**:
1. Character takes fatal damage in combat
2. `dam_killed_vict()` ‚Üí `die()` ‚Üí `raw_kill()` is called
3. `raw_kill()` calls `stop_fighting()` which cancels future combat events
4. BUT the current combat event is STILL EXECUTING in the call stack
5. Character state gets modified (moved rooms, affects added) while combat event runs
6. Memory corruption occurs due to unexpected state changes during active processing

**Proposed Solutions**:
1. **Immediate Fix**: Add validation checks in `event_combat_round()`:
   ```c
   if (!ch || IN_ROOM(ch) == NOWHERE || GET_POS(ch) == POS_DEAD) {
     return 0; // Cancel event
   }
   if (!IS_NPC(ch) && PLR_FLAGGED(ch, PLR_NOTDEADYET)) {
     return 0; // Character pending extraction
   }
   ```

2. **Alternative**: Add a "dying" flag to prevent combat processing during death
3. **Long-term**: Defer death processing until after all combat events complete

**Historical Code Analysis (from AI-FRIENDLY_PACK.xml)**:
The old stable version of `raw_kill()` had these key differences:
1. **Event Clearing**: Called `clear_char_event_list(ch)` immediately after `stop_fighting()`
   - This was commented out in newer code "for some reason"
   - The comment shows it was re-enabled: "undid that to make sure events clear on death"
2. **Affect Removal**: Cleared all affects before event clearing:
   ```c
   /* clear all affections */
   while (ch->affected)
     affect_remove(ch, ch->affected);
   ```
3. **Order of Operations**: 
   - Old: stop_fighting ‚Üí clear affects ‚Üí clear_char_event_list ‚Üí continue
   - New: stop_fighting ‚Üí continue (no immediate event clearing)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The crash is likely due to removing `clear_char_event_list(ch)` from the death sequence. Without this, combat events continue to execute on a character whose state is being modified (room changes, affect additions) during death processing.

**Recommended Fix**:
Re-add the `clear_char_event_list(ch)` call in `raw_kill()` right after `stop_fighting()`:
```c
/* stop relevant fighting */
if (FIGHTING(ch))
  stop_fighting(ch);

/* Clear all events to prevent race conditions */
clear_char_event_list(ch);
```

**Implemented Changes (2025-07-25)**:
1. **fight.c:2014**: Moved `clear_char_event_list(ch)` to execute immediately after `stop_fighting()` calls
   - This ensures all events are cleared before any state changes occur
   - Prevents combat events from executing on a character being processed for death

2. **fight.c:12519-12529**: Added safety checks at the beginning of `event_combat_round()`:
   - Check for NULL character, NOWHERE room, or DEAD position
   - Check for PLR_NOTDEADYET flag (player pending extraction)
   - Check for MOB_NOTDEADYET flag (NPC pending extraction)

**Additional Fix Attempt (2025-07-26)**:
After initial fix, crash still occurred but in a different location:
- New crash in `protocol.c` during MSDP affect updates
- Stack trace showed: `affect_remove()` ‚Üí `affect_total()` ‚Üí `update_msdp_affects()` ‚Üí crash in `AllocString()`
- Root cause: MSDP protocol updates being sent during death processing when character state is unstable

**Second Fix Applied**:
- Added check in `update_msdp_affects()` (handler.c:1016-1017) to skip MSDP updates when `PLR_NOTDEADYET` flag is set
- This prevents protocol operations during death processing

**Testing Required**:
- Test player death in various combat scenarios
- Verify no crashes occur during death processing
- Confirm combat events properly stop when character dies
- Monitor for any side effects of early event clearing
- Verify MSDP updates resume normally after death processing completes
