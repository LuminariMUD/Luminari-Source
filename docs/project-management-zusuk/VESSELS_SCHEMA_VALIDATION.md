# Vessels Phase 2 Schema Validation Report

## Installation Status: ✅ SUCCESSFUL

### Database: luminari_mudprod
### Date: January 18, 2025

## Test Results Summary

### 1. Schema Installation ✅
- All 5 tables created successfully
- All indexes properly configured
- Foreign key constraints working correctly

### 2. Tables Created ✅
| Table Name | Status | Records | Notes |
|------------|--------|---------|-------|
| ship_interiors | ✅ Created | 0 | Primary vessel configuration table |
| ship_docking | ✅ Created | 0 | Docking records with unique constraints |
| ship_room_templates | ✅ Created | 19 | Pre-loaded with room templates |
| ship_cargo_manifest | ✅ Created | 0 | Has FK to ship_interiors with CASCADE |
| ship_crew_roster | ✅ Created | 0 | Has FK to ship_interiors with CASCADE |

### 3. Room Templates ✅
19 room templates successfully loaded:
- Bridge/Control: bridge, helm
- Crew Quarters: quarters_captain, quarters_crew, quarters_officer
- Cargo: cargo_main, cargo_secure
- Engineering: engineering, weapons, armory
- Common Areas: mess_hall, galley, infirmary
- Connectivity: corridor, deck_main, deck_lower
- Special: airlock, observation, brig

### 4. Stored Procedures ✅
- `cleanup_orphaned_dockings()` - Created and callable
- `get_active_dockings(ship_id)` - Created and tested

### 5. Constraint Testing ✅
- PRIMARY KEY on ship_id working
- UNIQUE constraint on active dockings verified
- CASCADE DELETE tested - child records properly removed
- Indexes on foreign keys confirmed

### 6. Data Integrity Tests ✅
- Insert operations: Success
- Update operations: Success (timestamp auto-update working)
- Delete operations: Success (cascade delete verified)
- Foreign key enforcement: Working correctly

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Schema syntax validated
- [x] All tables created with proper structure
- [x] Indexes optimized for expected queries
- [x] Foreign keys with appropriate CASCADE rules
- [x] Stored procedures tested
- [x] Data integrity verified
- [x] Rollback script tested and ready
- [x] No conflicts with existing tables
- [x] Character encoding consistent (utf8mb4)
- [x] Timestamps using proper defaults

## Performance Considerations

### Index Coverage
- ship_interiors: Indexed on vessel_type, vessel_name
- ship_docking: Indexed on ship1_id, ship2_id, dock_status, dock_time
- ship_room_templates: Indexed on room_type, vessel_type
- ship_cargo_manifest: Indexed on ship_id, cargo_room, item_vnum
- ship_crew_roster: Indexed on ship_id, crew_role, status

### Expected Performance
- Lookups by ship_id: O(1) with primary key
- Docking queries: Optimized with composite indexes
- Room template queries: Fast with type indexes
- Foreign key checks: Efficient with proper indexing

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Before Deployment:**
   - Take full database backup
   - Review server logs for any existing vessel-related errors
   - Ensure adequate disk space (minimal impact expected)

2. **During Deployment:**
   - Run during low-traffic window
   - Execute verification script immediately after installation
   - Test basic vessel commands if possible

3. **After Deployment:**
   - Monitor error logs for 24 hours
   - Schedule weekly cleanup_orphaned_dockings() execution
   - Document any custom modifications needed

## Potential Issues & Mitigations

| Issue | Risk | Mitigation |
|-------|------|------------|
| FK constraint violations | Low | CASCADE DELETE implemented |
| Performance impact | Low | Proper indexes in place |
| Storage growth | Low | BLOB fields only for complex data |
| Procedure permissions | Low | Created with root, may need GRANT |

## Conclusion

The Vessels Phase 2 schema is **PRODUCTION READY**. All tests pass, constraints work correctly, and the rollback procedure is available if needed. The schema integrates cleanly with the existing database without conflicts.

### Certification
- Tested By: Development Team
- Date: January 18, 2025
