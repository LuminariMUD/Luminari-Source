### Strategic Rationale
The Greyhawk system provides the most advanced technical foundation with:
- Full integration with wilderness coordinate system (-1024 to +1024)
- Support for 500+ concurrent vessels anywhere in the world
- Terrain-aware navigation with elevation support
- Weather-affected movement and visibility
- Spatial audio integration for immersive vessel experiences

### âœ… TASK 2: WILDERNESS INTEGRATION - COMPLETED
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Completed:** January 2025  

#### 2.1 Coordinate System Integration âœ…
- Implemented `update_ship_wilderness_position()` in vessels.c:252-289

  - Ocean/Deep Water: 100% speed
  - Shallow Water: 75% speed
  - Land/Mountains: 0% for ships (impassable)
  - Airships: 100% at altitude > 100
- Weather affects movement distance and speed

#### 2.3 Integration Functions âœ…
Key functions implemented:
- `get_ship_terrain_type()` - Detects terrain at position
- `can_vessel_traverse_terrain()` - Validates movement

### âœ… TASK 3: VESSEL TYPES AND CAPABILITIES - COMPLETED
**Status:** COMPLETE  
**Completed:** January 2025  

#### 3.1 Vessel Classifications âœ…
Implemented in vessels.h:112-121:
```c
enum vessel_class {
    VESSEL_RAFT,           // Small, rivers/shallow water only
    VESSEL_BOAT,           // Medium, coastal waters
    VESSEL_SHIP,           // Large, ocean-capable
    VESSEL_WARSHIP,        // Combat vessel, heavily armed
    VESSEL_AIRSHIP,        // Flying vessel, ignores terrain
    VESSEL_SUBMARINE,      // Underwater vessel, depth navigation
    VESSEL_TRANSPORT,      // Cargo/passenger vessel
    VESSEL_MAGICAL         // Special magical vessels
};
```

#### 3.2 Terrain Interaction âœ…
Implemented in vessels.h:124-132:
```c
struct vessel_terrain_caps {
    bool can_traverse_ocean;      // Deep water navigation
    bool can_traverse_shallow;    // Shallow water/rivers
    bool can_traverse_air;        // Airship flight
    bool can_traverse_underwater; // Submarine diving
    int min_water_depth;          // Minimum depth required
    int max_altitude;             // Maximum flight altitude
    float terrain_speed_mod[40];  // Speed by terrain
};
```

#### 3.3 Environmental Effects âœ…
Weather integration implemented:
- Weather reduces movement distance in storms (25% reduction)
- Speed modifiers affected by weather severity
- Dynamic weather messages for immersion
- Airships more affected by weather than surface ships
- Submarines unaffected when underwater

## RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: Compilation Complexity
**Probability:** HIGH  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Mitigation:**
- Incremental compilation (one subsystem at a time)
- Maintain fallback branch for quick reversion
- Document all changes for rollback capability

#### Risk 2: Memory Overhead
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** HIGH  
**Mitigation:**
- Implement ship pooling system
- Use bit fields for boolean flags
- Compress coordinate data where possible
- Monitor memory usage continuously

#### Risk 3: Event System Conflicts
**Probability:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** MEDIUM  
**Mitigation:**
- Namespace all ship events (SHIP_EVENT_*)
- Use separate event queue if needed
- Careful integration with mud_event system
- Extensive event testing

#### Risk 4: Data Corruption
**Probability:** LOW  
**Impact:** CRITICAL  
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive bounds checking
- Validate all ship indices
- Null pointer guards on all accesses
- Database transaction safety
