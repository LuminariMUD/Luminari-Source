## Project Context: Luminari MUD Spatial Systems Development

You are working on **LuminariMUD**, a comprehensive MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) codebase written in C. The project has recently completed a major implementation of **spatial systems architecture** using a triple strategy pattern. You have full context of this completed implementation and are ready to continue development.

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED SYSTEMS

### Spatial Systems Architecture - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
**Location**: `/home/jamie/Luminari-Source/src/spatial_*`
**Status**: Production-ready, fully tested, and integrated

#### Core Files Implemented:
- **`src/spatial_core.c/.h`** - Core framework with triple strategy pattern
- **`src/spatial_visual.c`** - Complete visual system (distance, terrain occlusion, weather effects)  
- **`src/spatial_audio.c`** - Complete audio system (frequency-based, realistic dropoff, directional)

#### Integration Points:
- **`src/db.c`** - System initialization during MUD startup (`spatial_systems_init()`)
- **`src/pubsub_commands.c`** - Test command (`pubsub spatial`) for both visual and audio
- **`Makefile.am`** - Build system integration (all files compile cleanly)

#### Key Features Working:
1. **Visual System**: Distance-based visibility with terrain occlusion and weather effects
2. **Audio System**: Frequency-specific sound propagation with realistic distance dropoff
3. **Triple Strategy Pattern**: Extensible architecture for future spatial systems
4. **Environmental Effects**: Weather, terrain, elevation, and lighting integration
5. **Natural Messaging**: Immersive, contextual descriptions with proper directional language
6. **Performance Optimized**: Efficient calculation chains with early termination

#### Testing Confirmed Working:
- ✅ Compilation: Clean build with no warnings or errors
- ✅ Runtime: Both systems tested at various distances and conditions  
- ✅ Distance Dropoff: Realistic intensity curves for both visual and audio
- ✅ Directional Language: Proper "from the west" phrasing for audio
- ✅ Integration: Seamless operation with existing MUD systems

## Architecture Overview

### Triple Strategy Pattern Implementation
Each spatial system uses three coordinated strategies:

```
Strategy 1: Primary Calculation (Distance/Intensity)
Strategy 2: Line of Sight Analysis (Terrain Occlusion/Acoustic Blocking)  
Strategy 3: Environmental Modifiers (Weather/Lighting/Wind Effects)
```

### Current System Capabilities

#### Visual System (`spatial_visual.c`)
- **Distance Calculation**: Squared dropoff with elevation bonuses
- **Terrain Occlusion**: Mountains block sight, forests reduce visibility
- **Weather Effects**: Fog, rain, and lighting conditions affect visibility
- **Message Types**: Clear sight → distant glimpse → shadowy movement → barely visible

#### Audio System (`spatial_audio.c`)  
- **Frequency-Based Propagation**: Low/mid/high frequencies with different attenuation
- **Realistic Distance Dropoff**: Exponential decay with linear attenuation layers
- **Terrain Acoustics**: Mountains block sound, water carries it
- **Message Progression**: Clear → distant → muffled → echo → faint → rumble
- **Proper Directionality**: "from the west" not "to the west"

#### Core Framework (`spatial_core.c/.h`)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Extensible architecture for new spatial systems
- **Context Management**: Efficient parameter passing and state management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and validation
- **Performance**: O(1) per context, optimized for multiple observers

## Immediate Development Opportunities

### HIGH PRIORITY - Ready for Implementation

#### 1. Dynamic Weather Integration
**Goal**: Connect spatial systems to existing MUD weather system for real-time effects
**Implementation**: 
- Identify current weather system location and data structures
- Modify weather modifier strategies to use live weather data
- Test weather changes affecting visibility/audio in real-time

#### 2. Time of Day Integration  
**Goal**: Integrate with day/night cycle for automatic lighting effects
**Implementation**:
- Find existing time/lighting system in codebase
- Update visual lighting modifier strategy to use current game time
- Add dawn/dusk transition effects

#### 3. Elevation System Enhancement
**Goal**: Use actual room elevation data if available in the MUD
**Implementation**:
- Search for existing elevation/room height data structures
- Replace hardcoded elevation with real room data
- Add topographical advantages for high ground visibility

#### 4. Performance Optimization and Monitoring
**Goal**: Add performance metrics and optimization for large-scale events
**Implementation**:
- Add timing measurements to spatial processing
- Implement caching for frequently calculated contexts
- Profile memory usage and optimize allocation patterns

### MEDIUM PRIORITY - Future Enhancement

#### 5. Extended Audio Frequency Support
**Goal**: Add more specific audio frequency types beyond low/mid/high
**Implementation**:
- Expand `audio_frequency_t` enum with specific sound types
- Implement specialized propagation for each frequency type
- Add context-aware frequency selection

#### 6. Advanced Terrain Effects
**Goal**: Add specialized terrain types (caves, canyons, echo chambers)
**Implementation**:
- Extend terrain type handling in line of sight strategies  
- Add echo effects and reverberation for enclosed spaces
- Implement sound tunneling through canyon systems

#### 7. Multi-Source Spatial Events
**Goal**: Support multiple simultaneous spatial stimuli
**Implementation**:
- Extend context structure to handle multiple sources
- Implement source priority and mixing algorithms
- Add group event processing optimization

## Development Context and Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- **Architecture**: Follow established triple strategy pattern
- **Error Handling**: Use existing `SPATIAL_*` error codes  
- **Memory Management**: Stack-based contexts, minimal heap allocation
- **Performance**: Early termination strategies, efficient calculations
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive function and system documentation

### Integration Points to Consider
- **Existing Systems**: Weather, time/lighting, terrain, room elevation
- **Command Interface**: Extend `pubsub_commands.c` for new testing
- **Database**: Consider persistent configuration in existing DB schema
- **Networking**: PubSub system integration for distributed events

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Test new strategies independently
- **Integration Testing**: Use and extend `pubsub spatial` command
- **Performance Testing**: Monitor processing time with large observer groups
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure existing functionality remains unchanged

### Key Constants and Configuration
```c
// Audio system
#define AUDIO_BASE_RANGE 1500
#define AUDIO_THUNDER_RANGE 3000

// Visual system  
#define VISUAL_BASE_RANGE 1500

// Intensity thresholds (adjust as needed)
// Audio: Clear ≥0.8, Distant ≥0.5, Muffled ≥0.3, Echo ≥0.15, Faint ≥0.05
// Visual: Clear ≥0.8, Distant ≥0.6, Shadowy ≥0.4, Barely ≥0.2
