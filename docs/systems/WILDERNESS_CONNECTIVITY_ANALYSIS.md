## Zone Connectivity Patterns

### High-Connectivity Areas
1. **Major Cities** (4+ connections):
   - Ashenport (Zone 298): 4 wilderness connections
   - Sanctus (Zones 1-3): 4 wilderness connections  
   - Neverwinter (Zones 396-397): 4 wilderness connections

2. **Well-Connected Towns** (2-3 connections):
   - Tilverton (Zone 341): 3 connections
   - Hardbuckler (Zone 373): 2 connections
   - Grunwald (Zone 366): 2 connections

### Special Connection Types
- **Down exits** (7 locations): Cave/underground entrances
- **Multiple exits per room** (3 locations): Complex junction points

## Connectivity Assessment

### Strengths
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: 116 connection points provide extensive access
2. **Balanced Distribution**: Even directional spread prevents bottlenecks
3. **Major City Access**: All important cities have multiple wilderness connections
4. **Geographic Reach**: Connections span the entire coordinate space

### Potential Issues
1. **Isolated Zones**: Some zones may only have single wilderness connections
2. **Cluster Gaps**: Large coordinate areas without nearby connections
3. **Path Dependencies**: Some remote areas may require long wilderness travel

### Accessibility Rating: **EXCELLENT**

The wilderness system shows excellent connectivity with:
- 116 exit points providing comprehensive access
- Balanced directional distribution
- Multiple connections for major population centers
- Wide geographic coverage

## Recommendations for AI Region Development

### Priority Connection Areas
Based on the connectivity analysis, AI agents should focus region development on:

1. **High-Traffic Corridors**: Areas between major city clusters
2. **Junction Zones**: Regions containing multiple wilderness exits
3. **Travel Routes**: Connecting paths between distant exit points
4. **Remote Area Access**: Regions serving isolated wilderness exits

### Region Hint Opportunities
The wilderness exit data suggests these region types for AI development:

- **Gateway Regions**: Areas immediately around major city exits
- **Corridor Regions**: Travel routes between connection clusters  
- **Frontier Regions**: Remote areas around isolated exits
- **Junction Regions**: Complex areas with multiple nearby exits

This connectivity analysis shows a robust wilderness system that would greatly benefit from AI-generated region hints to enhance the travel experience between these 116 connection points.
