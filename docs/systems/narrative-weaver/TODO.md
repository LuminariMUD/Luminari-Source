# Narrative Weaver TODO - Remaining Work

**Last Updated**: August 23, 2025  
**Status**: Implementation 95% complete - Integration and content needed  
**Current**: 3,670 lines of advanced implementation with sophisticated features

---

## ðŸŽ¯ **ACTUAL REMAINING WORK**

### **PHASE 1: INTEGRATION VERIFICATION (HIGH PRIORITY)**

#### **Task 1.1: Verify Live Integration**
- [ ] **Check if narrative weaver is called** from wilderness description generation
- [ ] **Trace function call chain** from `desc_engine.c` to narrative weaver
- [ ] **Test with region 1000004 (The Mosswood)** in live game
- [ ] **Verify database connectivity** and hint loading in game environment

#### **Task 1.2: Integration Debugging**
- [ ] **Add debug logging** to track narrative weaver activation
- [ ] **Verify environmental context** is passed correctly
- [ ] **Test cache performance** in live environment
- [ ] **Check memory management** during extended play

#### **Task 1.3: Admin Interface**
- [ ] **Add admin commands** for narrative weaver management:
  ```c
  do_narrative_status()   // Show system status and cache stats
  do_narrative_test()     // Test region description generation
  do_narrative_reload()   // Reload hints and profiles from database
  do_narrative_debug()    // Toggle debug output
  ```

---

### **PHASE 2: CONTENT EXPANSION (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### **Task 2.1: Additional Regions**
- [ ] **Create hint sets for 3-5 new regions** using Mosswood as template:
  - Desert region (harsh, dry, survival-focused)
  - Mountain region (cold, windy, majestic)
  - Swamp region (humid, mysterious, dangerous)
  - Coastal region (salt air, waves, maritime)
  - Plains region (open, windy, pastoral)

#### **Task 2.2: Content Quality**
- [ ] **Develop content creation guidelines** for consistent quality
- [ ] **Create content templates** for different terrain types
- [ ] **Establish hint writing standards** for style and length
- [ ] **Quality assurance checklist** for new regions

#### **Task 2.3: Multi-Region Testing**
- [ ] **Test boundary transitions** between different region types
- [ ] **Validate multi-region influence calculations**
- [ ] **Performance test** with 10+ regions loaded
- [ ] **Memory usage analysis** with expanded content

---

### **PHASE 3: MANAGEMENT TOOLS (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**

#### **Task 3.1: Content Management Interface**
- [ ] **Region hint viewer** - display all hints for a region
- [ ] **Quality score manager** - review and approve content
- [ ] **Coverage analyzer** - identify regions missing hints
- [ ] **Performance monitor** - cache hit rates, query times

#### **Task 3.2: Builder Tools**
- [ ] **Hint creation wizard** for builders
- [ ] **Regional profile generator** based on templates
- [ ] **Content validation tools** for checking hint quality
- [ ] **Preview system** for testing descriptions before approval

#### **Task 3.3: Analytics Dashboard**
- [ ] **Usage statistics** - which hints are selected most often
- [ ] **Regional popularity** - player time spent in different regions
- [ ] **Performance metrics** - description generation times
- [ ] **Content gaps** - regions needing more hints

---

### **PHASE 4: POLISH & OPTIMIZATION (LOW PRIORITY)**

#### **Task 4.1: Performance Optimization**
- [ ] **Database query optimization** - batch loading, indexing
- [ ] **Memory pool management** - reduce allocation overhead
- [ ] **Cache tuning** - optimal TTL and size parameters
- [ ] **Lazy loading** - load region data on demand

#### **Task 4.2: Enhanced Features**
- [ ] **Player-specific descriptions** based on character background/skills
- [ ] **Temporal consistency** - remember recent descriptions for variation
- [ ] **Action-responsive content** - descriptions that react to player behavior
- [ ] **Dynamic weather integration** - real-time weather effect enhancement

#### **Task 4.3: Cross-System Integration**
- [ ] **Resource system integration** - descriptions reflect resource abundance
- [ ] **Event system hooks** - special descriptions for ongoing events
- [ ] **Quest integration** - region descriptions that hint at quests
- [ ] **Campaign-specific content** - Dragonlance/Forgotten Realms variants

---

### **PHASE 5: DOCUMENTATION & MAINTENANCE (ONGOING)**

#### **Task 5.1: Documentation Updates**
- [ ] **API documentation** for the implemented system
- [ ] **Builder guide** for creating regional content
- [ ] **Admin guide** for system management
- [ ] **Performance guide** for optimization

#### **Task 5.2: Content Maintenance**
- [ ] **Regular content review** for quality and freshness
- [ ] **Seasonal content updates** - special hints for holidays/events
- [ ] **Player feedback integration** - improve descriptions based on feedback
- [ ] **Content aging system** - retire overused hints

## ðŸŽ¯ **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (THIS WEEK)**

### **Day 1-2: Integration Verification**
1. Test narrative weaver with live game in region 1000004
2. Add debug logging to track system activation
3. Verify all components work in game environment

### **Day 3-4: Content Planning**
1. Analyze existing Mosswood content as template
2. Design content creation workflow for new regions
3. Create content style guide and standards

### **Day 5-7: First New Region**
1. Create complete hint set for one additional region
2. Test multi-region boundary effects
3. Performance analysis with expanded content
