    - Clean lines, vast spaces, weather-worn descriptions
  - [x] **Dramatic/Imposing** (Mountains, Cliffs) ‚úÖ
    - Grand scale, powerful imagery, commanding presence
  - [x] **Pastoral/Peaceful** (Meadows, Gentle hills) ‚úÖ
    - Soft imagery, comfort, tranquil atmospheres
  - [x] **Poetic/Artistic** (Default style) ‚úÖ
    - Flowing, artistic language with gentle embellishments

- [x] **Style Integration System**
  - Modify semantic element extraction to consider region style ‚úÖ
  - Add style-specific verb and adjective selection ‚úÖ
  - Create style-aware sentence structure patterns ‚úÖ
  - Higher integration weights for style-matching elements ‚úÖ

## üöß **Phase 2.3 - NEXT PRIORITIES**

### **Priority 1: Advanced Description Flow** ‚ú®
- [ ] **Punctuation and Flow Issues** - Description has awkward breaks
  - Fix sentence boundary detection
  - Improve natural flow between base and enhanced elements
  - Add transitional phrases where needed

- [ ] **Sensory Detail Integration** - Currently appending, should weave
  - Integrate sensory details into existing sentences
  - Avoid redundant descriptions
  - Create more natural sensory layering

## üìã **Phase 2.3 - PLANNED**

### **Enhancement Sophistication**
  - Expand mood indicator dictionary
  - Add more sophisticated verb injection patterns
  - Implement metaphorical language enhancement

- [ ] **Context-Aware Integration**
  - Weather-appropriate vocabulary selection
  - Elevation-based description modifications
  - Resource abundance storytelling

### **Narrative Flow Optimization**
- [ ] **Sentence Structure Variation**
  - Prevent repetitive sentence patterns
  - Add sentence complexity variation
  - Implement rhythm and pacing control

- [ ] **Transitional Intelligence**
  - Add smooth connections between description elements
  - Context-aware transition phrase selection
  - Natural paragraph flow

## üî¨ **Phase 3.0 - FUTURE**

### **Advanced Features**
- [ ] **Dynamic Vocabulary Selection**
  - Context-sensitive word choice
  - Atmosphere-appropriate language levels
  - Character perception-based descriptions

- [ ] **Narrative Memory**
  - Track recently used descriptions
  - Avoid repetition in nearby locations
  - Create location-specific narrative consistency

- [ ] **Interactive Elements**
  - Player action-influenced descriptions
  - Time-based description changes
  - Dynamic environmental storytelling

### **Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] **Caching System**
  - Cache parsed semantic elements
  - Store successful integration patterns
  - Optimize hint loading performance

- [ ] **Analytics & Tuning**
  - Track integration success rates
  - Monitor player engagement with descriptions
  - A/B testing for enhancement effectiveness

## üêõ **Current Issues to Fix**

### **Immediate Bugs**
1. **Time of Day Not Applied** - Morning/afternoon/evening/night context missing
2. **Seasonal Context Lost** - Winter atmosphere not being integrated
3. **Punctuation Issues** - Missing proper sentence separation
4. **Sensory Appending** - Should integrate, not append sensory details

### **Code Quality**
- [ ] Add more comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Improve debug logging granularity
- [ ] Add unit tests for semantic analysis functions
- [ ] Document API functions thoroughly

## üìä **Success Metrics**

### **Current Results**
- ‚úÖ Semantic integration weight: 0.40 (Good)
- ‚úÖ Dynamic element extraction: Working ("cascade")
- ‚úÖ Sensory detail extraction: Working (moss aroma description)
- ‚ùå Time of day integration: Missing
- ‚ùå Seasonal integration: Missing

### **Target Goals**
- Semantic integration weight: 0.6+ for rich regions
- 90%+ of time/seasonal hints utilized
- Natural flow score: 8/10 (subjective)
- Zero redundant descriptions
- Seamless base+hint integration

## üìù **Development Notes**

### **Recent Testing Results**
```
Location: (-53, 95) Mosswood
Base: "Visionary pine trees imagine the woodland's future splendor..."
Enhanced: Added sensory details and dynamic elements
Issues: Time (7am) and season (winter) context not applied
```

### **Next Implementation Priority**
1. Fix time of day integration in `extract_narrative_elements()`
2. Add seasonal context to mood transformation
3. Improve sentence flow and punctuation
4. Enhance sensory detail weaving
