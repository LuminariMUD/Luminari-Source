## Overview

The clan system in LuminariMUD provides a comprehensive framework for player organizations, allowing groups of players to form persistent associations with shared resources, communication channels, hierarchical structures, and territorial control through zone claiming. Clans are persistent player groups with member rankings, shared treasuries, private communication channels, zone ownership capabilities, and inter-clan diplomacy features.

## Core System Architecture

### Implementation Files

- **`clan.c`** - Core clan functionality, commands, and operations (~5670 lines)
- **`clan.h`** - Data structures, constants, macros, and function declarations
- **`clan_edit.c`** - Online clan editing interface (OLC) for administrators and clan leaders
- **`clan_benefits.h`** - Zone control benefits system definitions (HP/mana regen, exp bonuses, etc.)
- **`clan_transactions.c`** / **`clan_transactions.h`** - Transaction tracking and rollback system
- **`clan_economy.c`** / **`clan_economy.h`** - Economic features including investments and taxation

**Note**: `clan_benefits.c` does not exist as a separate file - benefits are integrated into the main clan system.

### Data Persistence

- **File Storage**: Clans are saved to `lib/etc/clans` in a custom text format
- **Player Storage**: Clan membership is stored in both player files and the player index
- **No MySQL Storage**: Unlike other systems, clans use file-based storage exclusively

## Data Structures

## Clan Ranks System

### Default Rank Structure
When a clan is created, it starts with 6 ranks:
1. **Rank 1**: Duke (Leader - highest rank)
2. **Rank 2**: Count (Officer)
3. **Rank 3**: Baron (Officer)
4. **Rank 4**: Lord (Officer)
5. **Rank 5**: Member
6. **Rank 6**: Recruit (lowest rank)

**Note**: The rank array is 0-indexed, so Duke is at index 0, Count at index 1, etc.

### Rank Features
- Customizable rank names per clan
- Each privilege has a minimum rank requirement
- Leaders (rank 1) always have full access
- Rank 0 is reserved for "leader only" privileges
- Lower rank numbers have higher authority (1 = highest, 6 = lowest)

## Zone Claiming System

### Claiming Mechanics
- Clans can claim zones to establish territory
- Claims tracked in `lib/etc/claims` file
- Popularity system tracks clan influence per zone
- Zone ownership provides benefits to clan members
- Requires minimum popularity threshold to claim
- Zones with ZONE_NOCLAIM flag cannot be claimed

### Claim Data
- Zone VNUM being claimed
- Player ID who made the claim
- Controlling clan VNUM
- Popularity values for each clan (0-100)

### Diplomacy Integration
- Diplomacy skills increase zone popularity
- Regular popularity checks update control
- Contested zones can change ownership

## Integration Points

### Character Data Macros
```c
GET_CLAN(ch)       // Returns character's clan VNUM
GET_CLANRANK(ch)   // Returns character's rank (1=leader)
GET_CLANPOINTS(ch) // Returns character's clan points
IS_IN_CLAN(ch)     // Check if character is in a clan
```

### Player Table Integration
- Clan membership stored in player index

### Communication System
- Dedicated clan channel with formatting
- Channel restrictions based on preferences
- Integration with noclantalk toggle

## Special Features

Adding clan 'Knights of Valor' (Leader: Gandalf) at VNUM 1
Clan added successfully.
```

### Joining a Clan
```
> clan apply Knights
You apply to join Knights of Valor.
Application fee of 0 coins has been deducted.
You will need a clan member with enrollment privileges to approve your application.
```

### Leaving a Clan (with confirmation)
```
> clan leave
You must type clan leave ABC123 to leave your clan.

> clan leave ABC123
You have left Knights of Valor.
```

### Clan Communication
```
> ct Hello clan members!
[CLAN] Gandalf: Hello clan members!
```

### Managing Members
```
> clan promote Frodo
Frodo has been promoted to Lord!

> clan demote Gollum  
Gollum has been demoted to Recruit!
```

## Best Practices

### For Players
- Choose meaningful clan names and descriptions
- Set appropriate application requirements
- Maintain active leadership succession
- Use clan banks for group resources
- Coordinate zone claiming efforts

### For Administrators
- Monitor clan activity and conflicts
- Enforce naming standards
- Resolve inter-clan disputes fairly
- Clean up inactive clans periodically
- Back up clan files regularly

## Important Implementation Notes

### File Dependencies
- The clan system requires `structs.h` for character and zone data structures
- Player clan data is stored in both character files and the player index
- Clan data persistence uses custom text format, not MySQL
- Hash table implementation requires proper initialization on boot

### Memory Management
- All clan strings (names, descriptions, rank names) use `strdup()` for allocation
- Proper cleanup is essential on clan removal and system shutdown
- Hash table entries are dynamically allocated and must be freed
- Transaction system maintains temporary data that requires cleanup

### Performance Considerations
- Hash table provides O(1) average case lookups for clans by VNUM
- Member count caching reduces expensive player file scanning
- Single clan saves prevent unnecessary full file rewrites
- Modification flags prevent redundant save operations

### Data Integrity
- Player index synchronization is critical for offline player clan data
- Transaction system provides rollback for failed multi-step operations
- Validation functions automatically repair corrupted clan data
- Backup files (.bak) are created during save operations

### Additional Future Enhancements
- MySQL database integration for better scalability
- Enhanced war mechanics with objectives
- Clan achievements/trophies system
- Cross-clan tournaments and competitions
- Clan skill bonuses implementation
- Web-based clan management interface
