# Bard Perk Trees - DDO-Inspired Expertise System

## Overview

Bards blend martial skill, arcane magic, and inspiring performance. These three perk trees provide clear specialization paths aligned with classic Bard archetypes seen across tabletop and MMO implementations. Each tree has four tiers of progression, with capstones at Tier IV.

**The Three Trees:**
1. **Spellsinger** – Spellcasting, song power, control, and support
2. **Warchanter** – Battle anthems, melee presence, and party-wide martial buffs
3. **Swashbuckler** – Agile duelist, finesse weapons, ripostes, and mobility

## Notes & Implementation Hints
- Treat “precision damage” as non-multiplied damage that stacks with sneak-like sources where appropriate.
- “Performance rounds” map to your existing bardic performance/chanting resource; regeneration and conservation effects should respect global limits.
- Song "effective level" can scale existing song formulas (duration, potency, save DC adjustments) without creating new song IDs.
- Control effects (stun/daze/slow/silence) should reuse your standard save/DC pipelines and immunity checks.
- Where abilities are “1/encounter” or “1/long rest,” adapt to your engine’s timers (cooldowns or daily flags) for parity with other class capstones.
