# Monk Perk Trees

## Overview
Monks are masters of martial arts, combining physical prowess with spiritual discipline. Through rigorous training and meditation, they channel ki energy to perform superhuman feats. They have three main perk trees focusing on different martial philosophies and combat styles.

## Design Notes

### Thematic Considerations
1. **Iron Fist**: Direct damage and raw power, inspired by traditional kung fu and martial arts mastery
2. **Way of the Shadow**: Ninja/assassin archetype from DDO's Ninja Spy tree, emphasizing stealth and precision
3. **Way of the Four Elements**: D&D 5e elemental monk tradition, focusing on ranged ki attacks and battlefield control through elemental manipulation

### Balance Points
- Total of 130 points worth of perks available across all trees
- Players earn approximately 90 perk points through leveling
- Forces meaningful choices - cannot max all three trees
- Each tree has distinct capstones worth pursuing
- Synergies reward focused builds but allow hybridization

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Basic damage increases and ki point modifications (Tiers 1-2)
2. **Phase 2**: Special ki abilities and strikes (Tier 3)
3. **Phase 3**: Ultimate capstone abilities (Tier 4)

### Integration with Existing Systems
- Ki points should integrate with existing ki pool mechanics
- Sneak attack bonuses stack with rogue levels
- Unarmed damage modifiers work with monk progression tables
- Movement bonuses stack with base monk speed
- Save bonuses stack with existing monk bonuses

### Combat Mechanics
- Elemental ki abilities should be usable at range and deal spell-like damage
- Physical attacks (Crushing Blow, Void Strike, etc.) should be usable once per combat or have cooldowns
- Shadow abilities should require stealth mode or surprise conditions
- Elemental transformations should provide both offensive and defensive benefits

### Ki Costs
- Basic abilities: 1-2 ki points
- Moderate abilities: 2-3 ki points  
- Powerful abilities: 3-5 ki points
- Ultimate abilities: 5+ ki points

## Future Expansion Ideas

### Additional Perk Concepts
- **Way of the Open Hand**: Enhanced stunning strikes and knockback effects (classic monk)
- **Way of the Drunken Master**: AC bonuses while appearing vulnerable, confusion effects, unpredictable movement
- **Way of the Long Death**: Life drain, fear effects, temporary HP from kills
- **Way of the Sun Soul**: Radiant damage, light-based attacks, healing
- **Way of the Kensei**: Weapon mastery for monk weapons, called shots
- **Way of Mercy**: Healing touch, remove conditions, resurrection
- **Four Winds**: Movement-based teleportation and position-swapping
- **Beast Style**: Animal-inspired fighting techniques (Crane, Mantis, Dragon, Tiger, Snake, etc.)

### Prestige-Style Perks
Could add special "master" perks that require high investment in a single tree:
- **Grandmaster of Iron Fist**: Requires 30+ points in Tree 1
- **Shadow Grandmaster**: Requires 30+ points in Tree 2  
- **Elemental Grandmaster**: Requires 30+ points in Tree 3

### Cross-Class Synergies
- Monk/Rogue: Enhanced sneak attack progression, improved stealth
- Monk/Cleric: Healing touch abilities, divine radiance
- Monk/Sorcerer: Ki can be used to fuel spells, spell-like abilities
- Monk/Ranger: Two-weapon fighting with unarmed strikes, nature-based ki
- Monk/Fighter: Improved critical range stacking, combat maneuvers
