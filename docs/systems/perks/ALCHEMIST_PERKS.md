# Alchemist Perk Trees - Pathfinder Expertise System

## Overview

Alchemists in Pathfinder are scientific experimenters who mix mutagens, craft alchemical items, and discover extraordinary abilities through their research. These three perk trees represent the core pillars of the Pathfinder Alchemist: personal enhancement through mutagens, specialized discoveries that unlock unique powers, and the art of crafting powerful extracts (alchemical spells). Each tree has four tiers of progression, with powerful capstones at Tier IV.

**The Three Trees:**
1. **Mutagenist** – Mutagen crafting, personal enhancement, and physical transformation
2. **Bomb Craftsman** – Alchemical bomb creation, elemental infusions, and tactical explosives
3. **Extract Master** – Alchemical extracts (bottled spells), infusions, and arcane knowledge

## Implementation Notes

### Alchemist Perk System Design Philosophy (Pathfinder-Inspired)

This perk system draws from the Pathfinder Alchemist class, which represents the pinnacle of combining science, magic, and practical alchemy to produce devastating effects and powerful enhancements.

1. **Three Core Mechanical Pillars:**

   - **Mutagenist (Personal Enhancement):** Based on the *Mutagen* class feature from Pathfinder. Creates personal enhancement buffs granting ability score bonuses. Mechanically similar to the Pathfinder alchemist's core identity of self-transformation. Perks emphasize personal survivability, exotic mutagen combinations, and scaling enhancement.
   
   - **Bomb Craftsman (Combat Explosives):** Based on the *Bomb* class feature from Pathfinder. Creates ranged touch attack weapons that deal area damage with elemental specializations and crowd control effects. Mechanically similar to Pathfinder's devastating bomb mechanics with +1d6 per level scaling and elemental discoveries. Perks emphasize damage output, elemental specialization, chain reactions, and area control.
   
   - **Extract Master (Spell Bottling):** Based on the *Extract* class feature from Pathfinder. Creates prepared spell-like infusions that function as potions or stored magical effects. Mechanically similar to Pathfinder's prepared spell system integrated with alchemy. Perks emphasize versatility, spell level progression, and party support through distributed extracts.

2. **Progression Balance:**
   - Tier I (1 point): Core ability unlocks (Mutagen I, Bomb I, Extract I) with basic synergies
   - Tier II (2 points): Feature expansion (additional abilities, elemental choices, specializations)
   - Tier III (3 points): Advanced mastery (combination mechanics, multi-effect abilities)
   - Tier IV (5 points): Capstone perks representing "ultimate" mastery of each tree
   
   Each tier builds on prerequisites from earlier tiers, creating a natural progression path.

3. **Pathfinder Mechanic References:**
   - **Mutagen Duration:** 10-20 minutes base (from Pathfinder's "10 minutes per alchemist level"), extendable to hours
   - **Mutagen Ability Boost:** +2 per ability score per rank (matches Pathfinder's +2 to one ability)
   - **Bomb Base Damage:** 1d6 + (1d6 per rank) (from Pathfinder's "1d6 per alchemist level")
   - **Bomb Area:** 5-foot radius splash (from Pathfinder's "5-foot radius")
   - **Extracts:** Prepared daily, can contain spells of levels 0-4 (from Pathfinder's spell levels 0-6 as alchemists progress)
   - **Infusions:** Alchemical discoveries that modify bomb, mutagen, and extract effects

4. **Synergy with Existing Systems:**
   - Mutagen bonuses integrate with ability score systems (STR for damage, DEX for AC, CON for HP, etc.)
   - Bombs use ranged touch attack mechanics (similar to rogue sneak attack delivery)
   - Extracts integrate with existing potion/buff systems
   - Saves use existing DC formulas (10 + character level + modifiers)
   - Action economy integrates with swift/standard/full-round action system

5. **Scaling Mechanics:**
   - **Mutagens:** Scale off ranks in Mutagen I-II perks and character level
   - **Bombs:** Scale with ranks in Alchemical Bomb perks, character level, and elemental specializations
   - **Extracts:** Scale with ranks in Alchemical Extract perks and spell levels available
   - **Synergies:** Infusion perks enhance parent tree (Mutagen II enhances Mutagen I, etc.)

6. **Crossover Mechanics:**
   - Mutagen perks can enhance bomb throws (Alchemical Reflexes grants AC/saves)
   - Extract perks can be distributed to allies (Resonant Extract and Discovery effects)
   - All three trees benefit from "mastery" high-level perks that unlock capstone abilities
   - Party synergy builds naturally from allowing allies to consume mutagens/extracts

### Potential Future Expansions

- **Prestige Paths:** Combine two trees for hybrid abilities (Mutagen + Bombs = "Volatile Mutagen Bombs")
- **Discoveries:** Unlock special perk effects tied to creature types defeated (dragon bombs, undead extracts)
- **Seasonal Alchemy:** Limited-time event perks for temporary exclusive effects
- **Transmutation Puzzles:** Dungeon encounters requiring alchemical solutions
- **Craft Recipes:** Rare formula drops from bosses that unlock new perk combinations
- **PvP Mechanics:** Balanced versions of perks for player-versus-player combat

---

## Cost Summary

- **Tier I:** 1 point × 4 perks = 4 points per tree
- **Tier II:** 2 points × 4 perks = 8 points per tree
- **Tier III:** 3 points × 4 perks = 12 points per tree
- **Tier IV:** 5 points × 2 perks = 10 points per tree

**Total per tree:** 34 points  
**Total for all three trees:** 102 points

An Alchemist can fully spec into one tree at character creation/early levels, with room to add perks from other trees or pursue capstones as they level.
