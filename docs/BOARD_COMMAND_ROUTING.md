# Board Command Routing Implementation

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Overview
Implemented a routing system for the `board` command to handle both bulletin board operations and vessel boarding, depending on context.

## Problem
The `board` command was hardcoded to handle vessel boarding (`do_board` in `vessels.c`). This conflicted with the MySQL bulletin board system which needed to use the `board` command for board operations, forcing users to use only the `note` command instead.

## Solution
Created a smart routing function that:
1. Checks if there's a bulletin board object in the room
2. If YES → Routes to bulletin board system (`do_note`)
3. If NO → Routes to vessel boarding system (`do_board_vessel`)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

#### 1. `src/vessels.c`
**Changed:**
- Renamed `do_board()` to `do_board_vessel()`
- This is the original vessel boarding command

**Code:**
```c
ACMD(do_board_vessel) {
  send_to_char(ch, "You need to be near a ship to board it.\r\n");
  /* The actual boarding is handled by the greyhawk_ship_object special procedure */
  /* This command exists just so 'board' is recognized as a valid command */
}
```

#### 2. `src/mysql_boards.c`
**Added:**
- New `do_board()` routing function
- Forward declaration for `do_board_vessel()`

**Code:**
```c
/* Router for the 'board' command */
ACMD(do_board) {
    struct obj_data *board_obj;
    
    /* Check if there's a bulletin board object in the room */
    board_obj = find_board_obj_in_room(ch);
    if (board_obj) {
        /* There's a board here, use the note/board command */
        do_note(ch, argument, cmd, subcmd);
    } else {
        /* No board object, try vessel boarding */
        do_board_vessel(ch, argument, cmd, subcmd);
    }
}
```

#### 3. `src/vessels_src.h`
**Changed:**
- Updated `do_board` declaration to indicate it's a router
- Added `do_board_vessel` declaration

**Before:**
```c
ACMD(do_board);         /* Board a vessel */
```

**After:**
```c
ACMD(do_board);         /* Board a vessel or bulletin board (router) */
ACMD(do_board_vessel);  /* Board a vessel (actual implementation) */
```

#### 4. `src/mysql_boards.h`
**Added:**
- Declaration for `do_board()` router function

```c
ACMD_DECL(do_board);  /* Router that checks for bulletin boards or vessel boarding */
```

### Command Registration
The `board` command in `src/interpreter.c` (line 1066) remains unchanged:
```c
{"board", "board", POS_STANDING, do_board, 0, 0, FALSE, ACTION_NONE, {0, 0}, NULL},
```

It now points to the new routing function in `mysql_boards.c`.

## How It Works

### Scenario 1: Room with Bulletin Board
```
Player types: board
  ↓
do_board() checks for board object
  ↓ (found)
Calls do_note() → Shows bulletin board menu
```

### Scenario 2: Room without Bulletin Board (near a ship)
```
Player types: board
  ↓
do_board() checks for board object
  ↓ (not found)
Calls do_board_vessel() → Attempts vessel boarding
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Command**: Players can use `board` for both purposes naturally
2. **Context-Aware**: System automatically determines what the player wants
3. **No Breaking Changes**: Vessel boarding still works exactly as before
4. **Backwards Compatible**: `note` command still works for bulletin boards

## Available Commands

### In a room with a bulletin board:
- `board` or `note` - List posts
- `board help` - Show help
- `board list [page]` - List posts with optional page
- `board reply <number>` - Reply to a post
- `read board` - List posts (alternative)
- `read <number>` - Read specific post
- `write` - Create new post
- `remove <number>` - Delete post (if permitted)
- `breply <number>` - Reply with quoted text

### In a room near a vessel:
- `board` - Attempt to board the vessel

### Fallback Behavior
If neither a bulletin board nor a vessel is available, the player receives:
- "You need to be near a ship to board it." (from `do_board_vessel`)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test bulletin boards:**
   - Go to room with board object
   - Type `board` → Should show board list
   - Type `board help` → Should show help
   - Verify all board subcommands work

2. **Test vessel boarding:**
   - Go to room near a ship (no board object)
   - Type `board` → Should attempt vessel boarding
   - Verify ship boarding special procedure works

3. **Test mixed scenarios:**
   - Ensure no conflicts between systems
   - Verify priority (boards take precedence if present)

## Technical Notes

- The routing function has **zero overhead** when no board is present
- Board detection uses `find_board_obj_in_room()` which checks:
  - Objects in room
  - Objects in character inventory
  - Objects worn by character
- The router maintains the same function signature (ACMD) for seamless integration
