# Wilderness-Crafting Integration Testing Commands for `ornir`

**Character:** ornir  
**Date:** August 10, 2025  
**Testing:** Phase 4.5 Enhanced Wilderness-Crafting Integration  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Phase 5 Harvesting Commands NOT YET IMPLEMENTED**

---

## üö® **Important Discovery**

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Phase 4.5**: Enhanced integration system implemented and ready
- ‚ùå **Phase 5**: Material harvesting commands **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Issue:** The wilderness system can survey and display resources, but there are **no actual commands** to harvest/collect those resources into storage. Commands like `gather`, `mine`, `collect` for wilderness materials don't exist yet.

**Available Commands Currently:**
- `survey resources` - Shows resource availability 
- `materials` - Shows stored materials (will show enhanced integration when materials exist)
- Admin commands: `addmaterial` - Can manually add materials for testing

**Missing Commands (Phase 5):**
- `harvest [resource_type]` - Harvest wilderness materials
- `gather [resource_type]` - Gather wilderness resources  
- `mine [resource_type]` - Extract mineral resources
- `collect [resource_type]` - Collect various resources

---

## üîß **Current Testing Options**

### **Option 1: Test Integration with Admin Commands**

If you have admin access, you can test the enhanced integration by manually adding materials:

#### **Step 1: Add Test Materials**
```
addmaterial ornir 3 1 3 5
```
**(Adds 5 uncommon kingfoil herbs)**

```
addmaterial ornir 1 2 4 3  
```
**(Adds 3 rare mithril ore)**

```
addmaterial ornir 5 1 5 1
```
**(Adds 1 legendary oak wood)**

#### **Step 2: Test Enhanced Integration Display**
```
materials
```
**Expected Enhanced Results:**
- Shows materials with enhanced descriptions
- Includes crafting applications and values
- Quality levels show different crafting bonuses
- Enhanced material IDs (1000+ range)

#### **Step 3: Verify Campaign Safety**
If other campaigns available:
```
campaign dl     # Switch to DragonLance  
materials       # Should show basic display only

campaign luminari   # Return to LuminariMUD
materials          # Should show enhanced display
```

### **Option 2: Test Survey System (Available Now)**

#### **Enter Wilderness Area:**
```
goto <wilderness_zone_number>
```

#### **Test Resource Surveying:**
```
survey resources
```
**Expected:** Shows 10 resource types with availability percentages

```
survey map vegetation 10
```
**Expected:** ASCII minimap showing vegetation distribution

```
survey detail herbs
```
**Expected:** Detailed analysis of herb resources in area

#### **Test Terrain Analysis:**
```
survey terrain
```
**Expected:** Detailed terrain information affecting resources

- ‚ùå Skill-based harvesting success
- ‚ùå Tool requirements for harvesting
- ‚ùå Resource depletion and regeneration

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

### **Phase 5 Implementation Needed:**

1. **Implement Harvesting Commands:**
   - `harvest [resource_type]` - Primary harvesting command
   - `gather [resource_type]` - General gathering command
   - `mine [resource_type]` - Mineral extraction
   - `collect [resource_type]` - Various resource collection

2. **Add Skill Integration:**
   - Use existing skills: ABILITY_SURVIVAL, SKILL_MINING, etc.
   - Success rates based on skill levels
   - Skill checks for harvest attempts

3. **Implement Resource Mechanics:**
   - Resource depletion when harvested
   - Regeneration over time
   - Quality determination based on skill/location

### **Testing Phase 5 Implementation:**

Once Phase 5 is implemented, the testing flow will be:

```
# Enter wilderness
goto <wilderness_zone>

# Survey resources  
survey resources

# Harvest materials (Phase 5 commands)
harvest herbs
mine metals  
collect wood

# Check enhanced integration
materials
```

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Enhanced Features Don't Appear:**

1. **Check Compilation:**
   ```
   whereis
   ```
   Verify you're in default campaign, not DL/FR

2. **Test Basic Harvesting:**
   ```
   gather herbs
   materials
   ```
   If basic harvesting works but no enhanced display, integration may not be compiled

3. **Try Different Material Types:**
   ```
   mine iron
   collect oak
   hunt deer
   materials
   ```
   Test multiple categories to verify integration

### **If Nothing Works:**

1. **Verify Wilderness Location:**
   ```
   survey resources
   ```
   Should show resource percentages (confirms wilderness)

2. **Check Character Permissions:**
   ```
   score
   ```
   Verify character can access wilderness features
