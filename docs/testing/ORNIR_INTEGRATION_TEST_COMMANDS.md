## üìä **Expected Success Indicators**

### ‚úÖ **Harvesting Working Correctly:**
- `harvest` command available and functional
- `gather` and `mine` commands work with appropriate restrictions
- Success/failure messages appropriate to resource availability
- Materials automatically added to storage
- Enhanced integration triggers for each harvest

### ‚úÖ **Integration Working Correctly:**
- Harvested materials appear in enhanced materials display
- Materials show enhanced descriptions with crafting info
- Quality levels affect crafting values appropriately
- Enhanced material IDs in 1000+ range
- Campaign safety maintained (basic display in DL/FR if available)

## üêõ **Potential Issues to Watch For**

### **If Commands Don't Work:**
1. **Command not found:** Verify you're using LuminariMUD campaign (not DL/FR)
2. **Wrong location:** Ensure you're in a wilderness zone
3. **No resources:** Use `survey resources` to verify availability

### **If Integration Doesn't Show:**
1. **Basic display only:** Check campaign setting
2. **No enhanced features:** Verify Phase 4.5 integration compiled correctly
3. **Empty storage:** Ensure harvesting is actually adding materials

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Enhanced Features Don't Appear:**

1. **Check Compilation:**
   ```
   whereis
   ```
   Verify you're in default campaign, not DL/FR

2. **Test Basic Harvesting:**
   ```
   gather herbs
   materials
   ```
   If basic harvesting works but no enhanced display, integration may not be compiled

3. **Try Different Material Types:**
   ```
   mine iron
   collect oak
   hunt deer
   materials
   ```
   Test multiple categories to verify integration

### **If Nothing Works:**

1. **Verify Wilderness Location:**
   ```
   survey resources
   ```
   Should show resource percentages (confirms wilderness)

2. **Check Character Permissions:**
   ```
   score
   ```
   Verify character can access wilderness features
