## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Enhanced Features Don't Appear:**

1. **Check Compilation:**
   ```
   whereis
   ```
   Verify you're in default campaign, not DL/FR

2. **Test Basic Harvesting:**
   ```
   gather herbs
   materials
   ```
   If basic harvesting works but no enhanced display, integration may not be compiled

3. **Try Different Material Types:**
   ```
   mine iron
   collect oak
   hunt deer
   materials
   ```
   Test multiple categories to verify integration

### **If Nothing Works:**

1. **Verify Wilderness Location:**
   ```
   survey resources
   ```
   Should show resource percentages (confirms wilderness)

2. **Check Character Permissions:**
   ```
   score
   ```
   Verify character can access wilderness features
