# Phase 4: Region Effects System - Installation and Testing

## Quick Setup

The easiest way to set up Phase 4 features is using the automated deployment:

```bash
# Full setup including database and region effects
./scripts/deploy.sh --auto --init-world

# Manual database setup only (if you ran deploy with --skip-db)
# Start the MUD and as an implementor run:
db_init_system wilderness
```

## Database Setup

If you need to manually install the region effects system:

```bash
# Navigate to the Luminari source directory
cd Luminari-Source

# Install the region effects system tables
# (Run inside the MUD as an implementor)
db_init_system wilderness
```

## Testing Region Effects System

### 1. Effects Management
```
# List all available region effects
resourceadmin effects list

# Show detailed information for a specific effect
resourceadmin effects show 1

# View all effects assigned to a region
resourceadmin effects region 1001
```

### 2. Enhanced Debug Survey
### 2. Enhanced Debug Survey
```
# The debug survey now shows region effects information
resourceadmin debug

# Example output will include:
# Region Effects:
#   Region: Forest of Testing (vnum 1001)
#     Effects: (New effects system - use 'resourceadmin effects region 1001')
```

### 3. Effect Assignment Commands
```
# Assign effects to regions
resourceadmin effects assign 1001 1 1.5    # Assign effect ID 1 to region 1001 with intensity 1.5
resourceadmin effects assign 1002 2 2.0    # Assign effect ID 2 to region 1002 with intensity 2.0

# Remove effect assignments
resourceadmin effects unassign 1001 1       # Remove effect ID 1 from region 1001
```

### 4. JSON Effect Configuration Examples
```
# Effects can have complex JSON parameters:
# Forest Growth Effect: {"vegetation_multiplier": 1.5, "herb_multiplier": 1.8, "wood_multiplier": 2.0}
# Seasonal Modifier: {"season": "spring", "growth_bonus": 0.3, "duration_days": 90}
# Environmental Curse: {"all_resources_penalty": -0.5, "curse_type": "blight"}
```
Resource Types for admin commands:
0 = vegetation    5 = wood
1 = minerals      6 = stone  
2 = water         7 = crystal
3 = herbs         8 = clay
4 = game          9 = salt
```

## Expected Changes

With region integration active, you should see:

## Effect Types and Applications

The new system supports various effect categories:

1. **Resource Modifiers**: Direct multipliers for resource types (vegetation, minerals, etc.)
2. **Environmental Effects**: Weather, seasonal, or magical influences
3. **Temporal Effects**: Time-based bonuses/penalties with expiration dates
4. **Conditional Effects**: Effects that activate based on specific criteria

The effects use JSON parameters for maximum flexibility and can be assigned to any region with customizable intensity values.

## Files Added/Modified

- `db_init_system wilderness` - Populates the flexible region effects schema with JSON parameters
- `src/resource_system.c` - Enhanced region effects processing with JSON support
- `src/resource_system.h` - Function prototypes for flexible effects system
- `src/act.wizard.c` - Comprehensive effects management admin commands
- Documentation updates reflecting new architecture

## Next Steps

Phase 4 is now complete with the flexible Region Effects System! The next development phase would be:

**Phase 5: Player Harvesting Mechanics**
- Interactive player harvesting commands that consume resources
- Dynamic resource regeneration over time
- Skill-based harvesting success rates and yields
- Tool and equipment requirements for different resource types
- Integration with existing crafting and economy systems
