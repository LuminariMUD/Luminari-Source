# UNIFIED VESSEL SYSTEM - PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**Project Code:** VESSELS-PHASE1-2025  
**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Created:** January 2025  
**Phase Duration:** 4 weeks (estimated)  
**Classification:** Technical Implementation Document  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Phase 1 Objective
Activate and validate the Greyhawk naval system as the foundation for LuminariMUD's unified vessel system. This phase establishes the core architecture while identifying integration points for future feature additions from Outcast and CWG systems.

### Strategic Rationale
The Greyhawk system provides the most advanced technical foundation with:
- Coordinate-based 3D positioning system
- Support for 500+ concurrent vessels
- Directional armor and tactical combat
- Robust event-driven architecture
- Performance-optimized data structures

---

## DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### TASK 1: CODE ACTIVATION AND COMPILATION
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Duration:** 2-3 days  
**Dependencies:** None  

#### 1.1 Enable Vessel Source Files
```
Actions Required:
- Remove #if 0 / #endif blocks from vessels_src.c
- Remove #if 0 / #endif blocks from vessels_src.h
- Verify all Greyhawk functions are exposed
- Confirm macro definitions are active
```

#### 1.2 Makefile Integration
```
File: src/Makefile
Add to OBJFILES:
  vessels_src.o

Add compilation rule:
  vessels_src.o: vessels_src.c vessels_src.h structs.h utils.h
```

#### 1.3 Header Inclusion
```
Files to modify:
- comm.c: #include "vessels_src.h"
- interpreter.c: #include "vessels_src.h"
- db.c: #include "vessels_src.h"
- structs.h: Forward declarations
```

#### 1.4 Compilation Error Resolution
```
Expected issues:
- Missing event system integration
- Undefined external variables
- Function signature mismatches
- Memory allocation patterns

Resolution approach:
- Create stub functions for missing dependencies
- Add extern declarations for global arrays
- Update function signatures to match Luminari patterns
```

### TASK 2: DATA STRUCTURE INTEGRATION
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Duration:** 2 days  
**Dependencies:** Task 1  

#### 2.1 Room Structure Enhancement
```c
File: structs.h
struct room_data {
  /* ... existing fields ... */
  struct greyhawk_ship_data *ship;  /* Pointer to ship data if room is ship */
}
```

#### 2.2 Global Arrays Declaration
```c
File: vessels_src.c
struct greyhawk_ship_data greyhawk_ships[GREYHAWK_MAXSHIPS];
int greyhawk_num_ships = 0;
struct greyhawk_ship_map tactical_map[100][100];  /* Tactical display grid */
```

#### 2.3 Memory Management
```
Initialization:
- All ship pointers start as NULL
- Lazy allocation on ship creation
- Proper cleanup on ship destruction
- Integration with mud's memory tracking
```

### TASK 3: COMMAND SYSTEM INTEGRATION

After world loading:
  log("Initializing ship systems...");
  greyhawk_initialize_ships();
  log("Ship systems initialized.");
```

#### 4.2 Ship Template Loading
```
Create initial templates:
1. Small Sloop (1-2 rooms, light armor)
2. Medium Frigate (3-5 rooms, medium armor)
3. Large Galleon (6-10 rooms, heavy armor)
4. Test Dinghy (1 room, minimal stats)
```

#### 4.3 Coordinate System Setup
```
World Origin Points:

```

### TASK 5: SPECIAL PROCEDURES
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Duration:** 2 days  
**Dependencies:** Tasks 1-4  

#### 5.1 Object Special Procedures
```c
Ship objects need:

- Proper object type (GREYHAWK_ITEM_SHIP = 57)
- Values: [0]=interior room, [1]=ship index
```

#### 5.2 Room Special Procedures
```c
Control rooms need:

- Proper room flags for ship interior
- Links to ship data structure
```

#### 5.3 Test Area Creation
```
Zone 399 - Ship Testing Harbor:

2. Two ships approach -> exchange fire -> one sinks
3. Ship docks at port -> passengers transfer -> undocks
4. 100 ships spawn -> all move -> check performance
```

#### 6.3 Stress Testing

- 500 ships active: < 10MB memory overhead
- Movement tick with 100 ships: < 50ms
