has_historical_context BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
has_resource_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE  
has_wildlife_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
has_geological_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
has_cultural_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
```

## Narrative Construction Process

### 1. Component Gathering Phase ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The system gathers narrative components from multiple sources:

**Procedural Base Descriptions**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Generated based on sector type, lighting, resource levels, time, weather, season
- Reflects real-time game world state and conditions via resource system integration
- Provides the foundational environmental context that players see

**Regional Enhancement Hints**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** 
- Weather-responsive regional atmosphere via `calculate_weather_relevance_for_hint()`
- Time-of-day regional variations via `get_time_weight_for_hint()`
- Seasonal regional adaptations via `get_seasonal_weight_for_hint()`
- Regional character and mood elements via `get_mood_weight_for_hint()`

**Real-Time Environmental Data**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Current weather patterns from `get_weather(x, y)`
- Time of day from game time system
- Seasonal context from calendar system  
- Resource availability and lighting conditions

**Builder Override System**: ⚠️ **INTEGRATION STATUS UNKNOWN**
- Static room descriptions where builders have created custom content
- Maintains builder creative control over specific locations
- Falls back to procedural + regional enhancement for non-overridden areas

### 2. Voice Validation and Transformation ✅ IMPLEMENTED

All components undergo voice validation and transformation via `transform_voice_to_observational()`:

**Voice Pattern Detection**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
```c
// Patterns automatically detected and transformed
"your footsteps" -> "footsteps"  
"you have stepped" -> "one steps"
"you " (at sentence start) -> "the area "
```

**Transformation Process**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Scan text for inappropriate voice patterns using string matching
- Apply contextual transformations with proper memory management
- Ensure consistent third-person observational voice throughout
description_version INT DEFAULT 1
ai_agent_source VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL
last_description_update TIMESTAMP

-- Style and presentation metadata
description_style ENUM('poetic', 'practical', 'mysterious', 'dramatic', 'pastoral')
description_length ENUM('brief', 'moderate', 'detailed', 'extensive')

-- Content characteristic flags
has_historical_context BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
has_resource_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE  
has_wildlife_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
has_geological_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
has_cultural_info BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE

-- Quality assurance fields
description_quality_score DECIMAL(3,2) DEFAULT NULL
requires_review BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
is_approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE
```

## AI-Generated Metadata Structure

### Seasonal Weight Coefficients
The system utilizes AI-calculated seasonal relevance weights:

    "midday": 0.60,
    "afternoon": 0.70,
    "dusk": 0.90,

## Example Output

### Before (Template-Based Hint System)
```
The Mosswood stretches endlessly in all directions, covered in ancient trees.
You see an ethereal green glow emanating from the bioluminescent moss patches, creating an otherworldly ambiance.
You notice the moss seems to pulse gently with an inner light.
```

### After (Template-Free Narrative Weaving)
```
The Mosswood stretches endlessly in all directions, an ancient mystical forest dominated by towering evergreens whose trunks are completely shrouded in thick, luminescent moss. Throughout the area, ethereal green light emanates from the bioluminescent moss patches, creating an otherworldly ambiance that pulses gently with inner radiance. Present conditions enhance this mystical atmosphere, as morning light filters through the moss-laden canopy, casting dancing patterns of natural and supernatural illumination across the forest floor.
