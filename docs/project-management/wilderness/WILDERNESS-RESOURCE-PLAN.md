   ```

### **Expected Resource Ranges**

Different terrain types should show different resource patterns:

**Forest Areas:**
- High: vegetation (60-80%), wood (50-70%), herbs (30-50%)
- Medium: game (30-50%), water (20-40%)
- Low: minerals (10-20%), stone (10-20%), crystal (2-8%)

**Mountain Areas:**
- High: stone (50-70%), minerals (40-60%), crystal (5-15%)
- Medium: water (20-40%), vegetation (20-40%)
- Low: herbs (10-20%), wood (10-20%), game (10-20%)

**Plains/Field Areas:**
- High: vegetation (50-70%), game (40-60%)
- Medium: herbs (30-50%), water (30-50%)
- Low: wood (10-30%), minerals (10-20%), stone (10-20%)

## 📦 **Core Resource Types**

The system supports a variety of gatherable and trackable resources:

- **Vegetation** – grasses, shrubs, general plant life
- **Minerals** – ores, metals, stones  
- **Water** – fresh water sources
- **Herbs** – medicinal or magical plants
- **Game** – huntable animals
- **Wood** – harvestable timber
- **Stone** – building materials
- **Crystal** – rare magical components
- **Clay** – crafting materials
- **Salt** – preservation materials

Each type stored independently, modified by terrain, region effects, and player interaction through lazy evaluation.

---

## 🧠 **Resource Calculation: Perlin Noise Foundation**

Each coordinate receives base resource values using **Perlin noise** for natural distribution patterns.

- **Per-resource noise layers**: Each resource type uses dedicated Perlin layer
- **Consistent generation**: Same values on subsequent calculations
- **Tunable parameters**: Frequency and amplitude per resource type
- **Environmental modifiers**: Seasonal and weather effects applied dynamically

```c
// Example calculation flow
float base_value = get_base_resource_value(RESOURCE_VEGETATION, x, y);
base_value = apply_region_modifiers(resource_type, x, y, base_value);
base_value = apply_environmental_modifiers(resource_type, x, y, base_value);
return apply_harvest_effects(resource_type, x, y, base_value);
```

---

## 📍 **Region-Based Modifiers**

Regions stored as polygons in MySQL can modify resource values:

- **Multipliers** (e.g., vegetation × 1.5 in forests)
- **Additive bonuses** (e.g., minerals +20% in mountains)  
- **Resource-specific effects** per region type
- **Simple database schema** for easy configuration

```sql
-- Simple region effects table
CREATE TABLE region_resource_effects (
    region_vnum INT,
    resource_type INT,
    multiplier FLOAT DEFAULT 1.0,
    bonus FLOAT DEFAULT 0.0
);
```

---

## 🌳 **Resource Tracking: KD-Tree Storage**

A **KD-tree** holds harvest history and consumption data keyed by `(x, y)`.

- **Harvest tracking only**: Only stores data for locations that have been harvested
- **Memory efficient**: Automatic cleanup of old, fully-regenerated nodes  
- **Lazy regeneration**: Time-based regeneration calculated on access
- **No events required**: Pure mathematical regeneration

```c
struct resource_node {
    int x, y;
    float consumed_amount[NUM_RESOURCE_TYPES];  // How much harvested
    time_t last_harvest[NUM_RESOURCE_TYPES];    // When harvested
    int harvest_count[NUM_RESOURCE_TYPES];      // Frequency tracking
};
```

---

## 🔄 **Lazy Regeneration System**

Resources regenerate through pure calculation, no events needed:

- **Time-based recovery**: Based on hours since last harvest
- **Configurable rates**: Per resource type regeneration speed
- **Environmental factors**: Weather and seasonal modifiers
- **Depletion resistance**: Diminishing returns on over-harvesting

```c
// Regeneration calculation example
float hours_passed = (now - last_harvest) / 3600.0;
float regenerated = consumed * regen_rate_per_hour * hours_passed;
consumed = MAX(0.0, consumed - regenerated);
current_value = base_value * (1.0 - consumed);
```
