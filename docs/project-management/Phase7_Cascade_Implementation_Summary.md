# Phase 7 Ecological Cascade System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Phase 7 ecological cascade system implements realistic ecological interdependencies where harvesting one resource type affects related resources in the environment. This creates a more authentic wilderness experience where player actions have cascading ecological consequences.

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Ecological Relationship Matrix
A comprehensive relationship system implementing these specific interactions:

**Vegetation Effects:**
- Affects Herbs: -3% (root system damage)
- Affects Game: -2% (habitat disruption)  
- Affects Clay: +1% (exposed soil)

**Herbs Effects:**
- Affects Vegetation: -2% (root network damage)
- Affects Game: -1% (food source reduction)

**Minerals Effects:**
- Affects Crystal: -8% (geological disruption)
- Affects Stone: -5% (structural weakening)
- Affects Gems: -3% (deposit shifting)

**Crystal Effects:**
- Affects Minerals: -4% (energy field disruption)
- Affects Gems: -2% (resonance interference)

**Stone Effects:**
- Affects Minerals: -3% (structural changes)
- Affects Crystal: -2% (pressure alterations)

**Gems Effects:**
- Affects Crystal: -1% (magical interference)

**Game Effects:**
- Affects Vegetation: -1% (trampling/grazing)

**Cloth/Leather/Special Resources:**
- No cascade effects (crafted/processed materials)

### 2. Database Integration
- Enhanced `resource_depletion` table with `cascade_effects` tracking
- Ecosystem health monitoring foundation
- Performance optimized with proper indexing
- Full MySQL integration with error handling

### 3. Enhanced Survey Commands

**New Commands Added:**
```
survey ecosystem    - Shows overall ecosystem health and trends
survey cascade <resource> - Preview cascade effects before harvesting
```

**Enhanced Help System:**
- Comprehensive help documentation explaining ecological relationships
- Interactive cascade preview system
- Ecosystem health analysis

### 4. Core System Functions

**Key Functions Implemented:**
- `apply_cascade_effects()` - Main cascade processing function
- `apply_single_cascade_effect()` - Individual resource effect application
- `show_cascade_preview()` - Player-facing cascade preview
- `show_ecosystem_analysis()` - Ecosystem health reporting
- `get_ecosystem_state()` - Health assessment logic

### 5. Harvest System Integration
- Seamless integration with existing Phase 6 depletion system
- `apply_harvest_depletion_with_cascades()` wrapper function
- Backward compatibility with all existing harvest mechanics
- Automatic cascade triggering on successful harvests

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. **src/resource_depletion.c** - Core cascade system implementation
2. **src/resource_depletion.h** - Function prototypes and declarations  
3. **src/resource_system.c** - Harvest integration point
4. **src/act.informative.c** - Enhanced survey commands

### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Added to resource_depletion table:
cascade_effects TEXT - Tracks applied cascade effects
ecosystem_health FLOAT - Overall ecosystem health (0.0-1.0)
```

### Performance Considerations:
- Cascade effects are capped at ±25% to prevent runaway effects
- Database queries optimized with proper indexing
- Lazy loading approach for ecosystem health calculations
- Efficient cascade preview without database impact

## Usage Examples

### For Players:
```
> survey ecosystem
Ecosystem Health Analysis for Whispering Woods (120, 89):
========================================================
Overall Health: Stable (78%)
Recent Activity: Moderate harvesting detected
[Detailed resource status display]

> survey cascade vegetation
Ecological Impact Preview - Harvesting Vegetation:
===========================================
↓ Herbs: -3% (root system damage)
↓ Game: -2% (habitat disruption)  
↑ Clay: +1% (exposed soil)
```

### For Administrators:
- All cascade effects are logged to game logs
- Database tracking of ecosystem health trends
- Integration with existing resource monitoring tools

## Future Phase Integration

This implementation provides the foundation for:
- **Phase 8:** Advanced ecosystem modeling
- **Phase 9:** Conservation mechanics and player reputation
- **Phase 10:** Dynamic resource regeneration based on health

## Testing Status

✅ **Compilation:** Code compiles successfully with no warnings
✅ **Database Schema:** Migration script ready for deployment
✅ **Integration:** Seamless integration with existing Phases 1-6
✅ **Documentation:** Comprehensive help system implemented

## Migration Instructions

1. **Backup Database:** Always backup before migration
2. **Run Migration:** Execute `db_init_system wilderness`
3. **Restart MUD:** Restart to initialize new cascade system
4. **Test Commands:** Verify `survey ecosystem` and `survey cascade` work
5. **Monitor Logs:** Check for cascade effect logging in game logs

## Configuration

The system is designed to work with default settings, but administrators can:
- Adjust cascade effect percentages in the relationship matrix
- Modify cascade effect caps (currently 25%)
- Customize ecosystem health thresholds
- Add new resource relationships as needed

This Phase 7 implementation creates a living, breathing ecosystem where every harvest action has meaningful ecological consequences, enhancing the realism and depth of the wilderness resource system.
