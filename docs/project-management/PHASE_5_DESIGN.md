# Phase 5: Player Harvesting Mechanics - Design Document

## üéØ **Overview**

Phase 5 introduces interactive player harvesting mechanics that allow players to actively gather resources from the wilderness, creating a dynamic economy where player actions affect resource availability and regeneration.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Features**

### 1. Interactive Harvesting Commands

**Primary Commands:**
```bash
harvest [resource_type]              # Harvest specific resource at current location
harvest                              # Show available resources and harvest options
survey                               # Show detailed resource availability (enhanced)
gather [amount] [resource_type]      # Gather specific amount of resource
```

**Advanced Commands:**
```bash
harvest all                          # Attempt to harvest all available resources
harvest quick [resource_type]        # Fast harvest with reduced yield/success
harvest careful [resource_type]      # Slow harvest with increased yield/success
track resources                      # Show resource regeneration timers
```

### 2. Resource Consumption System

**Depletion Mechanics:**
- Each harvest action reduces local resource availability
- Resources become "depleted" when harvested below minimum thresholds
- Different resources have different depletion rates and recovery times
- Over-harvesting creates "barren" areas with penalties

**Dynamic Availability:**
```
Current System: Resources calculated on-demand, always same values
New System: Resources tracked with current availability vs maximum potential
```

### 3. Skill-Based Success Rates

**Skill Integration:**
- **Survival Skill**: Primary skill for wilderness harvesting
- **Secondary Skills**: Specific skills for specialized resources
  - Herbalism: Herbs and medicinal plants
  - Mining: Minerals and stone
  - Foraging: Vegetation and food sources
  - Hunting: Game and animal resources

**Success Calculation:**
```c
base_success = 50 + (skill_level * 2)           // 50-150% base rate
resource_difficulty = resource_configs[type].difficulty   // Resource-specific difficulty
environmental_bonus = terrain_bonus + weather_bonus      // Environmental factors
tool_bonus = equipped_tool_bonus                         // Equipment bonuses

final_success = (base_success + environmental_bonus + tool_bonus) - resource_difficulty
```

### 4. Tool and Equipment Requirements

**Tool Categories:**
- **Basic Tools**: Hands, basic implements (50% efficiency)
- **Standard Tools**: Proper harvesting tools (100% efficiency) 
- **Masterwork Tools**: High-quality tools (150% efficiency)
- **Magical Tools**: Enchanted implements (200% efficiency + special bonuses)

**Resource-Specific Tools:**
```
Vegetation: Sickle, harvesting knife, gathering basket
Minerals: Pickaxe, mining hammer, prospector's tools
Herbs: Herbalism kit, gathering shears, preservation supplies
Wood: Axe, saw, woodcutting tools
Stone: Chisel, hammer, quarrying tools
Water: Containers, purification tablets, filtration kit
Game: Traps, hunting bow, tracking equipment
Crystal: Crystal picks, gem tools, magical focuses
Clay: Shovels, pottery tools, forming implements
Salt: Evaporation pans, scraping tools, refinement kit
```

### 5. Dynamic Resource Regeneration

**Regeneration Mechanics:**
- **Natural Recovery**: Resources slowly regenerate over time
- **Seasonal Cycles**: Regeneration rates vary by season
- **Environmental Factors**: Weather, region effects influence recovery
- **Player Impact**: Heavy harvesting areas recover more slowly

**Regeneration Formula:**
```c
regeneration_rate = base_rate * seasonal_multiplier * environmental_bonus * (1.0 - depletion_penalty)
current_amount = min(max_amount, current_amount + (regeneration_rate * time_elapsed))
```

**Time Scales:**
- Fast resources (vegetation, water): Hours to 1 day
- Medium resources (herbs, game): 1-3 days  
- Slow resources (minerals, crystal): 3-7 days
- Very slow (rare crystals, gems): 1-4 weeks

### 6. Harvesting Yields and Quality

**Yield Calculation:**
```c
base_yield = resource_configs[type].base_yield
skill_multiplier = 1.0 + (skill_level / 100.0)     // +100% at skill 100
tool_multiplier = tool_efficiency                    // 0.5 to 2.0
success_multiplier = (success_roll / 100.0)         // Partial success possible
region_multiplier = apply_region_effects()          // Existing system integration

final_yield = base_yield * skill_multiplier * tool_multiplier * success_multiplier * region_multiplier
```

**Quality Levels:**
- **Poor**: 50% value, basic crafting only
- **Common**: 100% value, standard crafting
- **Good**: 150% value, enhanced crafting bonuses
- **Excellent**: 200% value, rare crafting opportunities
- **Masterwork**: 300% value, legendary crafting potential

### 7. Integration with Existing Systems

**Crafting System Integration:**
- Harvested materials become crafting components
- Quality affects crafting success and final item stats
- Rare resources enable unique recipes

**Economy Integration:**
- Player shops can buy/sell harvested materials
- Regional price variations based on local availability
- Trade routes emerge based on resource distribution

**Experience and Advancement:**
- Successful harvesting grants skill experience
- Discovering new resource nodes provides exploration bonuses
- Mastery achievements for resource specialization

## üóÑÔ∏è **Database Schema Extensions**
