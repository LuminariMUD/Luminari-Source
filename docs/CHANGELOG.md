#### MariaDB Client Library Migration

**Date:** January 12, 2025  
**Developer:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** HIGH  

**Summary:**
Migrated from outdated local MySQL 5.0.51a headers (2008) to modern system-installed MariaDB client libraries for improved security, compatibility, and maintenance.

**Changes Made:**
- Removed local MySQL headers directory (`src/mysql/`) containing 16-year-old headers
- Updated all includes from `"mysql/mysql.h"` to `<mariadb/mysql.h>`
- Modified build systems to use pkg-config for MariaDB:
  - Updated Makefile.am to use `-lmariadb` instead of `-lmysqlclient`
  - Enhanced CMakeLists.txt to prioritize MariaDB over MySQL
- Updated all utility programs in `util/` to use MariaDB headers
- Fixed type compatibility issues (removed redundant `typedef bool my_bool`)

**Benefits:**
- **Security**: 16+ years of security patches now available
- **Compatibility**: Full support for modern MariaDB servers
- **Maintenance**: Automatic updates via package manager
- **Performance**: Access to optimizations and bug fixes

**Migration Notes:**
- Requires `libmariadb-dev` package installation
- Fully backward compatible with MySQL protocol
- No changes required to database server (works with both MariaDB and MySQL)

### December 2024

#### Help System File Loading Restoration

**Date:** December 12, 2024 (Updated)  
**Developer:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  

**Summary:**
Restored file-based help loading to maintain backward compatibility. The help system now operates in DUAL MODE, loading from both file (help.hlp) and database for maximum compatibility.

**Changes Made:**
- Restored `load_help()` function in db.c to read help.hlp file
- Re-enabled help_table allocation and memory management
- Restored help_sort() function for file-based entries
- Re-enabled qsort() call to sort file-based help entries
- System now operates in dual mode:
  - File-based help loaded at boot (help.hlp - 799KB of content)
  - Database help available via search_help()
  - Both systems work together seamlessly

**Important Notes:**
- NO HELP DATA WAS LOST - help.hlp file remains intact
- Migration to database-only is now a future task
- Need to create migration script before disabling file loading
- Current dual-mode ensures all help content is accessible

#### Help System Prepared Statements Implementation

**Date:** December 12, 2024  
**Developer:** AI Assistant

- Improved code maintainability and security best practices
- Foundation for converting other systems to prepared statements

### August 2025

#### MySQL Prepared Statement Bug Fixes

**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Developer:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  

**Summary:**
Fixed critical bugs in MySQL prepared statement implementation that caused all database help queries to fail and return NULL, forcing fallback to file-based help.

**Bugs Fixed:**
- **Incorrect is_null pointer handling** in mysql.c (lines 521, 526, 561)
  - `is_null` field was being set to literal values (0 or 1) instead of pointers to my_bool variables
  - MySQL C API requires `is_null` to be a pointer, not a value
  - Fixed both string and integer parameter binding functions
  
- **Insufficient buffer allocation for GROUP_CONCAT results**
  - `field->length` was often 0 or too small for aggregated results
  - GROUP_CONCAT can return very long concatenated strings
  - Increased minimum buffer size to 4096 bytes for all string fields
  - Ensured proper buffer sizing for aggregate function results

- **Missing memory cleanup for is_null pointers**
  - Parameter cleanup in `mysql_stmt_cleanup()` wasn't freeing allocated is_null pointers
  - Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

- **Enhanced error logging**
  - Added MySQL error codes and SQL state to all error messages
  - Added query logging for failed preparations
  - Added column type debugging for bind failures

**Impact:**
- Database help entries now load correctly instead of falling back to file-based help
- Soundex fuzzy matching (e.g., "help skore" suggesting "score") now works
- All prepared statements throughout the system now execute properly
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities remain in help system

**Files Modified:**
- src/mysql.c - Fixed is_null handling, buffer allocation, cleanup, and error logging

#### Critical Deity Loading Bug Fix

**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Developer:** AI Assistant  
**Status:** COMPLETED  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  

**Summary:**
Fixed a critical bug that prevented ALL deities from loading due to a typo in conditional compilation directive.

**Bug Details:**
- Line 86 of deities.c had `#if defined(CAMPAING_FR)` (typo - should be `CAMPAIGN_FR`)
- Because of the typo, the conditional was never true
- No `#else` clause existed for the default Luminari campaign
- Result: NO deities were loaded except "None", breaking all deity-related help and game features

**Fix Applied:**
- Fixed typo: `CAMPAING_FR` â†’ `CAMPAIGN_FR`
- Modified conditional to: `#if defined(CAMPAIGN_FR) || !defined(CAMPAIGN_DL)`
- This ensures FR deities load for both CAMPAIGN_FR and default Luminari campaigns
- DragonLance deities still load correctly when CAMPAIGN_DL is defined
- Added explanatory comments documenting the campaign-based loading logic

**Impact:**
- All deity help commands now work correctly (e.g., `help torm`)
- Deity selection during character creation now functions properly
- Cleric/Paladin deity-based features restored
- This bug likely affected the game since the campaign system was introduced
