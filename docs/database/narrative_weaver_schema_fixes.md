# Narrative Weaver Schema Inconsistencies - Resolution Summary

## Date: August 22, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Table Name Inconsistencies in Views
**Problem**: Views referenced non-existent table names with `ai_` prefix
**Tables Affected**:
- Views referenced `ai_region_hints` but actual table is `region_hints`
- Views referenced `ai_region_profiles` but actual table is `region_profiles`  
- Views referenced `ai_hint_usage_log` but actual table is `hint_usage_log`

**Fixed In**:
- `active_region_hints` view
- `hint_analytics` view

### 2. Foreign Key Reference Inconsistency
**Problem**: Foreign key in schema file pointed to non-existent table
**Location**: `hint_usage_log` table foreign key constraint
**Fixed**: Changed reference from `ai_region_hints(id)` to `region_hints(id)`

## Files Modified

### 1. `/sql/ai_region_hints_schema.sql`
- Fixed foreign key reference in hint_usage_log table definition
- Corrected table names in active_region_hints view
- Corrected table names in hint_analytics view

### 2. `/sql/fix_narrative_weaver_schema_inconsistencies.sql` (NEW)
- Migration script to fix existing database views
- Added verification queries
- Added migration tracking record

## Database Changes Applied

### Views Recreated:
- `active_region_hints` - Now correctly references `region_hints` and `region_profiles`
- `hint_analytics` - Now correctly references `region_hints` and `hint_usage_log`

### Foreign Key Verification:
- Confirmed `hint_usage_log.hint_id` correctly references `region_hints.id`
- Cascade delete functionality preserved

## Verification Results

✅ **Views Working**: 
- `active_region_hints` returns 19 records
- `hint_analytics` returns 9 analytics records

✅ **Foreign Keys Correct**:
- `hint_usage_log_ibfk_1` correctly points to `region_hints(id)`

✅ **Integration Maintained**: 
- Narrative weaver code continues to work without changes
- All database queries remain functional

## Impact Assessment

- **✅ Zero Downtime**: Changes were backward compatible
- **✅ No Code Changes Required**: Application code was unaffected
- **✅ Data Integrity Preserved**: All existing data remained intact
- **✅ Functionality Enhanced**: Views now work correctly with proper data

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

All schema inconsistencies have been corrected. The narrative weaver database infrastructure is now fully consistent and all components are functioning properly.
