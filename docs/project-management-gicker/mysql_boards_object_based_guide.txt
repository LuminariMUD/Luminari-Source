# MySQL Board System Implementation Instructions for LuminariMUD (Object-Based Version 2.1 with Reply System)

## Prerequisites
1. Ensure MySQL client library is installed and linked in your Makefile
2. Have MySQL server running with appropriate database created
3. Copy mysql_boards.c and mysql_boards.h from Age of Dragons codebase (complete object-based system)

## IMPORTANT: Complete Feature Set Overview
This is a fully-featured board system using OBJECT VNUMs instead of room VNUMs. Complete feature set includes:

### Core Features:
- **Object-based boards**: Boards tied to objects that can be moved between rooms, carried by players, or worn as equipment
- **Automatic synchronization**: Board configurations automatically sync with database on MUD startup
- **Reply system**: Full reply functionality with quoted original messages and smart subject handling
- **SQL injection protection**: All user input safely escaped using mysql_real_escape_string
- **Special character support**: Board posts can contain quotes, apostrophes, and other special characters
- **Production security**: Complete protection against SQL injection attacks

### Advanced Features:
- **Intelligent quoting**: Reply posts automatically format original messages with "|" prefix
- **Smart subject lines**: Reply subjects use "Re: Post #X" format for clear reference tracking
- **Flexible editing**: Users can modify or delete quoted content during reply composition
- **Multi-access patterns**: Boards accessible in room, inventory, or worn equipment
- **Level-based permissions**: Separate read/write/delete permission levels per board
- **Clan integration**: Optional clan-specific board restrictions

## Step 1: Database Configuration

Create a mysql_info.h file with your MySQL connection details:
```c
// MySQL Stuff
#define MYSQL_SERVER      "127.0.0.1"
#define MYSQL_DB          "your_mud_database"
#define MYSQL_PASSWD      "your_password"
#define MYSQL_USER        "your_username"
#define NUM_ILLEGAL_MYSQL_CHARS 2
```

## Step 2: Global MySQL Connection Setup

### In your main db.c file:

1. Add includes at the top:
```c
#include "mysql_boards.h"
#include "mysql_info.h"
```

2. Add global MySQL connection variable:
```c
MYSQL *conn;
```

3. Initialize MySQL connection in boot_db() function:
Add this code in your boot_db() function, after basic initialization but before loading zones:
```c
log("Initializing MySQL board system.");
if (mysql_board_init()) {
  log("   MySQL board system initialized successfully.");
  log("   Board configurations synchronized with database.");
} else {
  log("   MySQL board system initialization failed!");
}
```

**IMPORTANT**: The mysql_board_init() function will now:
- Create necessary database tables if they don't exist
- Automatically synchronize board configurations from the default_boards[] array
- Update existing boards with any configuration changes
- Use INSERT...ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE for safe database synchronization

## Step 3: Command Integration

### In interpreter.c:

1. Add the header include:
```c
#include "mysql_boards.h"
```

2. Add external MySQL connection:
```c
extern MYSQL *conn;
```

3. Add command function declarations:
```c
ACMD(do_read_board);
ACMD(do_write_board);
ACMD(do_remove_board);
ACMD(do_reply_board);
ACMD(do_note);
```

4. Add commands to the command table:
```c
{"board", POS_RESTING, do_note, 1, 0},
{"note", POS_RESTING, do_note, 1, 0},
{"read", POS_RESTING, do_read_board, 0, 0},
{"remove", POS_RESTING, do_remove_board, 1, 0},
{"write", POS_STANDING, do_write_board, 1, 0},
{"breply", POS_STANDING, do_reply_board, 1, 0},
```

## Step 4: String Editor Integration

### In modify.c:

1. Add header include:
```c
#include "mysql_boards.h"
```

2. Add board post completion handling in string_add() function:

Find the section where CON_EXDESC cases are handled (around the switch statement
that handles different connection states), and add this case alongside the existing ones:

```c
case CON_BOARD_POST:
  extern void mysql_board_finish_post(struct descriptor_data *d, int save);
  if (!d->str) {
    bug("SYSERR: string_add: CON_BOARD_POST with NULL d->str");
    mysql_board_finish_post(d, 0);
  } else {
    mysql_board_finish_post(d, 1);
  }
  break;
case CON_BOARD_POST_ABORT:
  extern void mysql_board_finish_post(struct descriptor_data *d, int save);
  mysql_board_finish_post(d, 0);
  break;
```

## Step 5: Look Command Integration

### In act.informative.c (or wherever your look command is implemented):

1. Add the external function declaration:
```c
extern void show_board_in_room(struct char_data *ch);
```

2. Integrate board display in the look command:

Find your do_look function and in the section where room descriptions are shown
(typically after showing the room description but before showing exits), add:

```c
/* Show board information if there's a board object accessible */
show_board_in_room(ch);
```

## Step 6: Configuration Structure Updates

### Add these constants to your structs.h or conf.h:

```c
/* Connection states for board posting */
#define CON_BOARD_TITLE         XX  /* Replace XX with next available CON_ number */
#define CON_BOARD_BODY          XX  /* Replace XX with next available CON_ number */
#define CON_BOARD_POST          XX  /* Replace XX with next available CON_ number */
#define CON_BOARD_POST_ABORT    XX  /* Replace XX with next available CON_ number */
```

### Update descriptor structure (in structs.h):

Add these fields to your descriptor_data structure:

```c
struct descriptor_data {
    /* ... existing fields ... */
    int board_id;                /* Board ID for board posting system */
    char *board_title;           /* Title being written for board post */
    int reply_to_post_id;        /* Post ID being replied to (0 = not a reply) */
    /* ... remaining fields ... */
};
```

## Step 7: Makefile Updates

Ensure your Makefile includes:
1. MySQL client library linking: -lmysqlclient
2. MySQL include path: -I/usr/include/mysql (adjust path as needed)
3. Add mysql_boards.o to your object files list

## Step 8: Board Configuration and Object Creation

### Customize the default boards in mysql_boards.c:

Modify the default_boards array to match your MUD's object vnums and level structure:

```c
static struct mysql_board_config default_boards[] = {
    /* board_id, name, type, read_lvl, write_lvl, delete_lvl, obj_vnum, clan_id, active */

    // IMPORTANT! BOARD NAMES CANNOT CONTAIN ' (single quote) unless you implement
    // additional escaping in the synchronization function

    // Immortal Boards
    {1, "Immortal General Board", BOARD_TYPE_IMMORTAL, 31, 31, 36, 1200, 0, true},
    {2, "Immortal Development Board", BOARD_TYPE_IMMORTAL, 31, 31, 36, 1201, 0, true},

    // Player Boards
    {3, "General Board", BOARD_TYPE_GENERAL, 1, 1, 31, 3099, 0, true},
    {4, "Roleplay Board", BOARD_TYPE_RP, 1, 1, 31, 3098, 0, true},

    // Add more boards as needed
    {-1, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, false} /* End marker - don't remove */
};
```

**Configuration Notes:**
- **board_id**: Unique identifier for each board
- **board_name**: Display name (avoid single quotes in names)
- **board_type**: Type constant (see Board Types section)
- **read_level/write_level/delete_level**: Minimum character levels required
- **obj_vnum**: Object VNUM for the board object in your world files
- **clan_id**: Clan restriction (0 = no restriction)
- **active**: Whether board is currently active

**Auto-Synchronization**: When you modify this array and restart the MUD, changes will automatically be applied to the database. You can:
- Add new boards (will be inserted)
- Update existing board configurations (will be updated)
- Change names, levels, or object VNUMs (will sync automatically)

### Create Board Objects:

You will need to create board objects in your object files (.obj files) that correspond to the obj_vnums specified above. Example board object:

```
#3099
Keywords: bulletin board general notice~
Short: a bulletin board~
Long: A large wooden bulletin board is mounted on the wall here. Various notices and
messages are pinned to its cork surface with small brass tacks. The board appears
well-used and is titled "General Board" across the top.~
ActionDesc:
Type: OTHER
ExtraFlags: 0
WearFlags: 0
Values: 0 0 0 0
Weight: 50
Cost: 1000
Rent: 0
ExtraDesc: board bulletin notices messages~
This is a bulletin board where players can post messages for others to read.
You can use 'board' or 'note' commands to interact with it.
~
#
```

NOTE: Board objects can now be placed in any room, carried by players, or even worn
(if you set appropriate wear flags). The board system will find and use any accessible
board object when players issue board commands.

## Step 9: Level Constants

Ensure these level constants exist in your codebase (adjust to match your level system):
- LVL_IMMORT - Immortal level
- LVL_GADMIN or LVL_GRGOD - Greater admin level
- LVL_QUEST - Quest level (or substitute appropriate level)

## Step 10: Compilation and Testing

1. Compile the MUD - Fix any missing includes or conflicting definitions
2. Create the database tables - The system will auto-create tables on first run
3. Create board objects in your world files using the vnums specified in default_boards
4. Test basic functionality:
   - Load a board object into a room or player inventory
   - board or note - Show available commands
   - read - List posts on a board (when you have access to a board object)
   - write - Create a new post
   - board reply <post#> - Reply to an existing post with quoted text
   - breply <post#> - Alternative reply command
   - remove <post#> - Remove a post (if you have permissions)

## Step 11: Object Access Priority

The board system searches for board objects in this order:
1. Objects in the room where the player is located
2. Objects in the player's inventory
3. Objects worn by the player

## Step 12: Board Reply System Usage

### Reply Command Syntax:
```
board reply <post number>
breply <post number>
```

### Reply Process:
1. **Post Selection**: System verifies the original post exists and you have read access
2. **Subject Entry**: Prompted for additional subject text (optional)
   - Post number is automatically prefixed with "Re: Post #"
   - Your additional text is appended after " - "
   - Example: "Re: Post #5 - Your Additional Text"
3. **Quoted Content**: Original message is automatically quoted with "|" prefix
   - Each line of original message prefixed with "| "
   - Author and post number information included
   - Separator line added for your new content
4. **String Editor**: Opens with quoted content pre-loaded for editing
   - You can delete parts of the quoted text you don't want
   - Add your reply below the "--- Your reply below this line ---" separator
   - Use standard string editor commands (/s to save, /h for help)

### Reply Features:
- **Safe quoting**: All special characters properly handled in quoted content
- **Flexible editing**: Full control over what parts of original message to keep
- **Clear formatting**: Visual separation between quoted and new content
- **Automatic titling**: Smart subject line generation with "Re: Post #" prefix

## Step 13: Board OLC System

### Board Management Commands:

#### Creating a New Board:
```
bedit new
```
This opens the board editor with a new board template. The system automatically assigns the next available board ID.

#### Editing an Existing Board:
```
bedit <board_id>
```
Opens the specified board for editing. Use `blist` to see all board IDs.

#### Listing All Boards:
```
blist
```
Displays a comprehensive list of all boards with their configurations:
- Board ID
- Board Name
- Board Type
- Read/Write/Delete Levels
- Object VNUM
- Clan Restrictions
- Active Status

### Board Editor Menu Options:

1. **Board ID** - View only (cannot be changed once created)
2. **Name** - Set the display name for the board
3. **Type** - Choose from: General, Immortal, Clan, Quest, Roleplay, Announcement, Newbie
4. **Read Level** - Minimum character level required to read posts
5. **Write Level** - Minimum character level required to create posts
6. **Delete Level** - Minimum character level required to delete posts
7. **Object VNUM** - The object VNUM that represents this board in the game
8. **Clan ID** - Set to 0 for no restriction, or a clan ID for clan-only boards
9. **Active** - Toggle board active/inactive status
Q. **Quit** - Exit editor (prompts to save if changes were made)

### Board Editor Workflow:

1. Enter `bedit new` or `bedit <id>`
2. Modify desired fields by entering their number
3. Enter 'Q' to quit
4. Confirm save when prompted
5. Board is saved to database and loaded into memory immediately

### Important Notes:

- **No Restart Required**: Changes take effect immediately upon saving
- **Database Persistence**: All boards stored in MySQL database
- **No Code Changes**: Boards are fully managed through in-game OLC
- **Security**: SQL injection protection on all board fields
- **Object VNUMs**: Must create corresponding board objects in your world files
- **Permission Levels**: Adjust based on your MUD's level system

### Example: Creating a New Board

```
> bedit new
-- Board Editor
1) Board ID     : 25
2) Name         : New Board
3) Type         : General
4) Read Level   : 1
5) Write Level  : 1
6) Delete Level : 31
7) Object VNUM  : 0
8) Clan ID      : 0 (0 = no clan restriction)
9) Active       : Yes
Q) Quit
Enter choice : 2

Enter board name : Tavern Notice Board
-- Board Editor
1) Board ID     : 25
2) Name         : Tavern Notice Board
...
Enter choice : 7

Enter object VNUM for this board : 5100
...
Enter choice : Q

Do you wish to save this board internally? (y/n) : y
Board saved to database.
Board saved.
```

### Migrating from Hardcoded Boards:

If you have existing boards in the `default_boards[]` array:

1. The system will continue to work with existing boards in memory
2. Use `bedit <id>` to edit existing boards and save them to the database
3. Once all boards are in the database, you can remove the hardcoded array
4. The `mysql_board_sync_default_boards()` function can be used for initial import if needed

## Step 14: Optional Enhancements

Consider these additional integrations:
1. Clan-specific boards - Modify board permissions to check clan membership
2. Level-restricted boards - Already supported in the base system
3. Email notifications - Add hooks to notify players of new posts
4. Web integration - Create web interface to read/post to boards
5. Portable boards - Allow certain board objects to be picked up and moved
6. Equipment boards - Create wearable board objects (like a message scroll)
7. Reply threading - Track reply relationships in database for threaded views

## Security Features

### SQL Injection Protection
The system now includes comprehensive protection against SQL injection attacks:

1. **String Escaping**: All user input is processed through `mysql_real_escape_string()`:
   - Post titles are escaped before database insertion
   - Post bodies (including multi-line content) are safely escaped
   - Author names are escaped to prevent injection through character names
   - Board names are escaped during configuration synchronization

2. **Buffer Management**:
   - Escaped string buffers are properly sized (original_length * 2 + 1)
   - Query buffers are large enough to accommodate escaped content
   - No buffer overflows during string processing

3. **Safe Characters**: Posts can now safely contain:
   - Single quotes (')
   - Double quotes (")
   - Backslashes (\)
   - Special SQL characters
   - Multi-line content with various formatting

### Database Synchronization Security
- Board configuration updates use `INSERT...ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`
- Configuration data is escaped before database operations
- Safe handling of board name updates and modifications

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **MySQL connection issues**: Verify mysql_info.h settings and database permissions
2. **Command not found**: Check command table entries and function declarations
3. **Segfaults**: Ensure all MySQL result sets are properly freed
4. **String editor issues**: Verify CON_ state handling in modify.c
5. **Board not found**: Ensure board objects exist with correct VNUMs and are accessible
6. **Database schema**: The system automatically updates the database schema to use obj_vnum instead of room_vnum
7. **Compilation errors**: Ensure MySQL development headers are installed
8. **String escaping issues**: Verify mysql_real_escape_string is working correctly
9. **Buffer overflow warnings**: Check that query buffers are large enough for escaped content
10. **Board sync issues**: Check that default_boards[] array has proper terminator entry

## System Overview

The board system will automatically create the necessary database tables
(mysql_boards and mysql_board_posts) on first initialization. Each board is tied
to a specific object vnum, and players can read/write when they have access to that
object based on their level and permissions.

### Key Changes from Room-Based System:
- **Object-based architecture**: Uses obj_vnum instead of room_vnum in database and configuration
- **Flexible placement**: Searches for board objects in room, inventory, and equipment
- **Multiple boards**: Multiple boards can exist in same location
- **Portable boards**: Boards are now portable and can be moved around
- **Backward compatibility**: Legacy mysql_board_get_config_by_room() still works by searching for objects in specified room
- **Auto-synchronization**: Configuration changes automatically sync with database on startup
- **Security hardening**: Complete SQL injection protection for all user inputs

### Enhanced Security Features:
- **Input sanitization**: All strings processed through mysql_real_escape_string
- **Buffer safety**: Proper buffer sizing for escaped content
- **Injection protection**: Safe handling of special characters in all text fields
- **Configuration security**: Board names and settings safely escaped during sync
