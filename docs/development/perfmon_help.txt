PERFCONFIG

Usage: perfconfig [off|basic|sampling|full|dynamic|<number>]

The perfconfig command controls the server's performance monitoring system.
This allows administrators to adjust monitoring overhead based on current needs.

Monitoring Levels:
  off      - Disable all performance monitoring (0% overhead)
  basic    - Monitor only when performance exceeds 100% (minimal overhead)
  sampling - Sample every N pulses (default: 1/10, ~90% reduction)
  full     - Monitor every pulse (original behavior, highest overhead)
  
Additional Options:
  dynamic  - Toggle automatic high-load monitoring (on/off)
  <number> - Set sampling rate (e.g., "perfmon 20" = sample 1/20 pulses)

Current Status:
  Type "perfmon" with no arguments to see current monitoring status.

Dynamic Monitoring:
  When enabled, the system automatically switches to full monitoring when
  server load exceeds 150% and returns to sampling mode when load drops
  below 130%.

Examples:
  perfconfig           - Show current status
  perfconfig sampling  - Use sampling mode (recommended for production)
  perfconfig full     - Enable full monitoring (for debugging)
  perfconfig 5        - Sample every 5th pulse
  perfconfig dynamic  - Toggle automatic load-based monitoring

Note: This command requires Greater God level (LVL_GRGOD) privileges.
