# Short Description Requirement - Implementation Summary

## Change Overview
Added a check to prevent players from entering the game without setting their short description when the introduction system is disabled.

## What Was Changed

**File**: `src/interpreter.c`  
**Function**: CON_MENU state handler, case '1' (Enter Game)  
**Lines**: Added ~12 lines of code at line 4295

### Code Added:
```c
case '1':
  /* Check if introduction system is OFF and player hasn't set short description */
  if (!CONFIG_USE_INTRO_SYSTEM && 
      (GET_PC_DESCRIPTOR_1(d->character) == 0 || GET_PC_ADJECTIVE_1(d->character) == 0))
  {
    write_to_output(d, "\r\n");
    write_to_output(d, "\tYThe introduction system is currently disabled on this MUD.\tn\r\n");
    write_to_output(d, "\tYYou must set up your character's short description before entering the game.\tn\r\n");
    write_to_output(d, "\r\n");
    show_short_description_main_menu(d);
    break;
  }

  load_result = enter_player_game(d);
  // ... rest of normal game entry code continues
```

## How It Works

### Trigger Conditions (BOTH must be true):
1. **CONFIG_USE_INTRO_SYSTEM** is set to OFF/NO
2. **Short description is not set** (either descriptor or adjective is 0)

### When Triggered:
- Player sees a yellow-colored message explaining the requirement
- Player is automatically redirected to the short description setup menu
- Player cannot enter the game until setup is complete

### When Not Triggered:
- Introduction system is enabled (players use intro system instead)
- Short description is already set (both values > 0)
- Player enters game normally

## Player Experience

### Before This Change:
```
MAIN MENU
1) Enter the game
[Player selects 1]
[Player enters game with no description - appears as "someone"]
```

### After This Change:
```
MAIN MENU
1) Enter the game
[Player selects 1]

The introduction system is currently disabled on this MUD.
You must set up your character's short description before entering the game.

SET CHARACTER SHORT DESCRIPTION: PRESS ENTER
[Player goes through short description setup]
[Player can now enter the game]
```

## Technical Details

### Checked Values:
- **GET_PC_DESCRIPTOR_1(d->character)**: First descriptor type (e.g., complexion, build)
- **GET_PC_ADJECTIVE_1(d->character)**: First adjective (e.g., pale, muscular)

### Valid State for Entry:
- Both values must be > 0 (indicating they've been set)
- If either is 0, player needs to complete setup

### Configuration:
- **CONFIG_USE_INTRO_SYSTEM**: Set in `src/config.c` or via cedit command
- When set to YES: Players can enter without short description
- When set to NO: Short description is required

## Compilation Status

2. **docs/SHORT_DESCRIPTION_REQUIREMENT_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Files Modified

1. **src/interpreter.c** - Added validation check in CON_MENU case '1'

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] New character with intro system OFF - required to set description
- [ ] Existing character with description set - enters normally
- [ ] New character with intro system ON - enters without requirement
- [ ] Partial description (only descriptor set) - still requires completion
- [ ] Partial description (only adjective set) - still requires completion

## Related Systems

- **Introduction System**: CONFIG_USE_INTRO_SYSTEM setting
- **Short Description System**: `src/char_descs.c`
- **Character Description Data**: `src/players.c` (save/load)
- **Description Setup States**: CON_GEN_DESCS_* states

## Benefits

✅ Prevents players from entering game without proper identification  
✅ Improves immersion when introduction system is disabled  
✅ Clear messaging explains why entry is blocked  
✅ Automatic redirection to setup (no manual navigation)  
✅ Respects configuration - only applies when needed  

## Notes

- This check only applies when introduction system is **disabled**
- Players with existing descriptions are not affected
- The check happens at game entry, not character creation
- Staff/admins can reset descriptions via appropriate commands
