# LuminariMUD Deployment Status Report

> **⚠️ OBSOLETE DOCUMENT**: This document describes historical issues with `setup.sh` which is no longer the recommended deployment method. Use `./scripts/deploy.sh` instead. This file is kept for historical reference only.

**Date:** September 3, 2025
**Status:** OBSOLETE - Use deploy.sh instead

## Current State

### ✅ What Works
1. **Source Code**: Successfully cloned from GitHub
2. **Build System Generation**: `autoreconf -fvi` generates configure script properly
3. **Configuration**: `./configure` completes successfully
4. **Compilation**: `make` builds all source files without errors
5. **Installation**: `make install` places binaries in `bin/` directory
6. **Setup Script**: `./scripts/setup.sh` runs through all steps

### ❌ What's Broken
1. **Server Won't Stay Running**: 
   - Binary exists at `./bin/circle`
   - Starts briefly then immediately exits
   - No persistent process
   - No log output (syslog not created)

2. **Missing World Files**:
   - Server exits with: `SYSERR: opening index file 'world/zon/index': No such file or directory`
   - Symlinks created but pointing to non-existent directories
   - Minimal world files not being copied properly

## Deployment Attempt Log

### Step 1: Clone Repository ✅
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuminariMUD/Luminari-Source.git
cd Luminari-Source
```
- **Result**: Success

### Step 2: Run Setup Script ⚠️
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```
- **Initial Issue**: Script failed with "No targets specified and no makefile found"
- **Root Cause**: Script doesn't run `autoreconf -fvi` first
- **Fix Applied**: Added autoreconf step to setup.sh

### Step 3: Manual Build Steps ✅
```bash
autoreconf -fvi    # Generate build system
./configure        # Create Makefile
make              # Compile source
make install      # Install to bin/
```
- **Result**: All steps complete successfully
- **Binary Location**: `./bin/circle` exists

### Step 4: Start Server ❌
```bash
./bin/circle -d lib
```
- **Result**: Server starts, shows initialization messages, then immediately exits
- **Error**: Cannot find world files at expected locations
- **No crash log**: `log/syslog` never created

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: World File Setup
The setup script creates symlinks:
```bash
ln -sf lib/world world
ln -sf lib/text text  
ln -sf lib/etc etc
```

But the actual world files don't exist in `lib/world/`:
- No zone files in `lib/world/zon/`
- No room files in `lib/world/wld/`
- No mob files in `lib/world/mob/`
- No object files in `lib/world/obj/`

### Secondary Issues
1. **Setup Script Incomplete**: 
   - Creates directories but doesn't populate them
   - Attempts to copy from `lib/world/minimal/` which may not exist
   - No error checking for missing source files

2. **Documentation Mismatch**:
   - Guide claims "working" but deployment fails
   - Scripts updated but not fully tested end-to-end

---

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Locate/Create Minimal World Files**:
   - Check if `lib/world/minimal/` exists in repo
   - If not, create minimal viable world data
   - Ensure indexes are created with proper format

2. **Fix Setup Script**:
   - Add verification that world files exist after copying
   - Add error messages when files can't be found
   - Ensure all required directories are created AND populated

3. **Add Diagnostics**:
   - Server should create log file even when failing
   - Add verbose startup option to see exactly where it fails
   - Better error messages for missing files

### Test Deployment
After fixes:
1. Clean everything: `make clean`
2. Remove all generated files and directories
3. Run setup script from scratch
4. Verify server starts and stays running
5. Confirm can connect on port 4000

---

## Summary

The deployment is **80% complete**. The codebase builds successfully but lacks the minimal world data needed to actually run. This is a data/configuration issue, not a compilation problem.

**Critical Missing Piece**: Minimal viable world files that allow the server to boot.
