# Deployment Fix Summary

**Date:** September 3, 2025  
**Issue:** Setup script was broken - didn't create proper index files  
**Status:** ATTEMPTED FIX - NOT VERIFIED

## The Problem

The `setup.sh` script had broken logic for copying world files:
1. Tried to copy non-existent `index.zon`, `index.wld`, etc. files from `lib/world/minimal/`
2. These files don't exist - only `0.zon`, `0.wld`, `0.mob` exist
3. No `.obj` file exists in minimal, causing server crash
4. Index files weren't being created properly

## The Fix

Updated `setup.sh` to:
1. **Check for actual files** that exist (`0.zon`, not `index.zon`)
2. **Create proper index files** with format:
   ```
   0.zon
   $
   ```
3. **Generate a minimal object file** if none exists
4. **Handle missing files gracefully** 

## Key Changes to setup.sh

```bash
# OLD (BROKEN):
cp lib/world/minimal/index.zon lib/world/zon/index  # File doesn't exist!

# NEW (FIXED):
if [[ -f lib/world/minimal/0.zon ]]; then
    cp lib/world/minimal/*.zon lib/world/zon/
    echo "0.zon" > lib/world/zon/index
    echo '$' >> lib/world/zon/index
fi
```

## Minimal Object File Creation

Since no `.obj` file exists in minimal, the script now creates one:
```bash
cat > lib/world/obj/0.obj << 'EOF'
#1
bread~
a loaf of bread~
A loaf of bread is here.~
~
11 0 0 0 0 a 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
1 100 10 0 0
$
EOF
```

## Deployment Should Now Work

From fresh clone:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LuminariMUD/Luminari-Source.git
cd Luminari-Source
./scripts/setup.sh
./bin/circle -d lib
```

Server should start and run on port 4100 (or 4000 depending on config).
