  - Ring: +Y to hitroll, +Y to damroll, +Y to AC

Bonuses and scaling:
- Enhancement for most items X = floor(target level / 5)
- Ring bonus Y = floor(target level / 6)

- All items are auto-sized to the target’s current size.

Restrictions:
- You can only set a kit for characters lower level than you.
- Command requires LVL_GRSTAFF or higher.

Side effects:
- Target is notified and their character is saved after items are created.

    Gives Kaelin a level-scaled set of test weapons, armor, a shield (if proficient), a test amulet (+all stats), and a test ring (+hit/dam/AC).

- Item prototypes are taken from the configured outfit object prototypes and may vary by campaign setup.
- Intended for quick QA/testing builds; not balanced for live gameplay.
