# LuminariMUD Documentation Audit & Update Progress Tracker v2.1

## 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANT 🚨

### BEFORE YOU START - READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION

1. **Find Your Position**: Look for `>>> CURRENT POSITION <<<` marker below
2. **Check Working Memory**: Read the session context (max 500 chars)
3. **Estimate Context Budget**: Use size checks before reading files
4. **Work Systematically**: Complete all checks for each file
5. **Update Progress**: Mark items and move position marker
6. **Leave Clear Notes**: Update working memory before stopping

### CONTEXT BUDGET SYSTEM

**Token Usage Estimates:**
- Tiny file (<50 lines): ~50-100 tokens
- Small file (50-100 lines): ~100-200 tokens
- Medium file (100-500 lines): ~500-1000 tokens
- Large file (500-1000 lines): ~1000-2000 tokens
- Huge file (1000+ lines): ~2000-5000 tokens
- Tool calls: ~50-100 tokens each
- Edits: ~100-200 tokens per edit

**Session Budget Guidelines:**
- Target: 10,000-15,000 tokens per session
- Safety margin: Stop at ~12,000 to allow for final updates
- Always `wc -l filename.md` before reading large files
- Use `grep -n "pattern" file` for targeted searches in huge files

### ADAPTIVE WORKFLOW

1. **Scout Phase** (Do this FIRST each session)
   ```bash
   # Check file sizes
   ls -la docs/*.md | grep -E "(README|GUIDE|SYSTEM)"
   wc -l docs/*.md | sort -n
   ```

2. **Planning Phase**
   - Review checkpoint files and sizes
   - Select session type based on needs
   - Group related files for efficiency

3. **Execution Phase**
   - Read files in order of dependency
   - Check all items in checklist
   - Fix issues immediately when found
   - Use MultiEdit for batch changes

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify all links work
   - Confirm examples are accurate
   - Check consistency across docs

### QUALITY CHECKLISTS BY FILE TYPE

#### For All Files:
- [ ] File exists at specified location
- [ ] Headers/sections properly formatted
- [ ] Internal links use correct paths
- [ ] Code examples compile/work
- [ ] No outdated version numbers
- [ ] Consistent terminology used

#### For Setup/Build Guides:
- [ ] Prerequisites accurate
- [ ] Commands work as written
- [ ] Platform-specific notes included
- [ ] Common errors documented

#### For API/Technical Docs:
- [ ] Function signatures current
- [ ] Parameters documented
- [ ] Return values specified
- [ ] Examples provided
- [ ] Edge cases noted

#### For System Documentation:

### COMMON ISSUES TO WATCH FOR

1. **C Standard Confusion**
   - WRONG: "C99 standard"
   - RIGHT: "ANSI C90/C89 standard"
   - Check: Makefile has NO -std=c99 flag

2. **Path Problems**
   - Docs reorganized in 2025
   - Many `/guides/` paths now direct under `/docs/`
   - Always verify actual locations

3. **Version Mismatches**
   - Current: LuminariMUD 2.4839 (tbaMUD 3.64)
   - Check constants.c for authoritative version

4. **Missing Dependencies**
   - MySQL/MariaDB requirements
   - Library dependencies (libcrypt, libgd, etc.)
   - Build tool requirements

### SESSION TYPES

**Type A: Sprint Session** (10-15 small files)
- Example: All README files, licenses, configs
- Budget: ~2000-3000 tokens
- Good for: Initial surveys, quick fixes

**Type B: Standard Session** (3-5 medium files)
- Example: Setup guides, system overviews
- Budget: ~5000-8000 tokens
- Good for: Most documentation work

**Type C: Deep Dive Session** (1-2 large files)
- Example: DEVELOPER_GUIDE_AND_API.md
- Budget: ~8000-12000 tokens
- Good for: Comprehensive reviews

**Type D: Search & Fix Session** (Many files, targeted)
- Example: Fix all "C99" references across docs
- Budget: Varies based on grep results
- Good for: Consistency fixes

**Type E: Validation Session** (No full reads)
- Example: Check all internal links
- Budget: ~3000-5000 tokens
- Good for: Final quality checks

### Metrics Dashboard
- Total Files to Review: ~45+
- Files Completed: 0
- Files In Progress: 0
- Blocked Files: 0
- Critical Issues Found: 0
- Links Fixed: 0

---

## RED FLAGS & QUICK FIXES

### Immediate Fix Patterns
1. **C Standard**: `s/C99/ANSI C90\/C89/g`
2. **Doc Paths**: Remove `/guides/` from most paths
3. **Version**: Should be "LuminariMUD 2.4839 (tbaMUD 3.64)"

### Watch For These Issues
- ❌ "C99 standard" anywhere
- ❌ `#include <stdbool.h>` in examples
- ❌ `for (int i = 0; ...)` in code examples
- ❌ `/docs/guides/` paths (mostly removed)
- ❌ Old version numbers
- ❌ Dead external links
- ❌ Missing security warnings

### Quick Validation Commands
```bash
# Find all C99 references
grep -r "C99" docs/

# Find all potential bad paths
grep -r "docs/guides" docs/

# Count markdown files
find docs -name "*.md" | wc -l

# Find large files
find docs -name "*.md" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -n

# Check for broken internal links
grep -r "\[.*\](.*.md)" docs/ | grep -v http
```

## NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION

When starting a new session:
1. **Check your last position** via CURRENT POSITION marker
2. **Read working memory** for context
3. **Run size check** on next checkpoint files
4. **Select session type** based on files and time
5. **Update session log** when starting

Before ending a session:
1. **Complete current file** (don't leave mid-edit)
2. **Update all checkmarks** accurately
3. **Move position marker** to next checkpoint
4. **Update working memory** with key findings
5. **Log session stats** in history table

---

## EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

### If Context Limit Hit
1. Save working memory immediately
2. Note exact position in current file
3. Commit any completed edits
4. Create "PARTIAL_" checkpoint marker
5. Resume from marker next session

### If Major Issue Found
1. Document in working memory
2. Add to RED FLAGS section
3. Create GitHub issue if critical
4. Note in session history
5. Prioritize fix in next session
