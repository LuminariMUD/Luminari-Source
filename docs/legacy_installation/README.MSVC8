                 Compiling CircleMUD under Microsoft Windows XP
                     using Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 (8.0)


The following information is from by Jason Pullara. You can contact him at

Compiling with MS Visual C++ 8.0:

1.  In the src directory, rename conf.h.win to conf.h.

2.  Go to File|New Project... Create a new workspace called circle.
    Put the root directory path into the location field.

3.  Select "Win32 Console Application." Click OK.

4.  On the next screen Select "Application Settings" and check "Empty
    Project" under the "Additional Options" heading. Click Finish.

5.  In the solution explorer, right click on the "header" folder, and select
    Add->Existing Item...

6.  Select all of the .h files in the src directory and click Add.

7.  In the solution explorer, right click on the "source" folder, and select
    Add->Existing Item...

8.  Select all of the .c files in the src directory and click Add.

9.  In the solution explorer, right click on the workspace name ("circle").
    Select properties.

10. In the solution properties dialog box, under Configuration Properties,
    select "General"

11. Change "Character Set" to "Use Multi-Byte Character Set"*

12. In the solution properties dialog box, expand "Linker" and select
    "Input"

13. Under the "Additional Dependencies" add wsock32.lib and click OK.

14. Save all.

15. In the menu click Build->Build Solution (or press Ctrl-Shft-B).
    CircleMUD should now build.

16. Move the circle.exe file from the circle/Debug directory to the root
    directory.

17. You're done! =)


* Yes, you have to change it to multi-byte character set, otherwise MSVC8
  will throw a hissey-fit about being unable to convert char to wchar_t.
