echo "=================================="
echo ""
echo "ISSUE: Descriptions showing 'bright midday sun' at 7 PM"
echo "ROOT CAUSE: Function using wrong constants and no time granularity"
echo ""
echo "FIXES IMPLEMENTED:"
echo "1. Updated add_temporal_atmosphere() to use game's SUN_* constants"
echo "2. Added time-based granularity within SUN_LIGHT period:"
echo "   - Hours 6-10: 'gentle light of morning'"
echo "   - Hours 10-14: 'bright midday sun'"  
echo "   - Hours 14-18: 'warm afternoon light'"
echo "   - Hours 18-21: 'fading daylight of evening'"
echo "3. Removed unused TIME_* constants from header"
echo ""
echo "GAME TIME SCHEDULE:"
echo "- Hours 5-6: SUN_RISE (dawn)"
echo "- Hours 6-21: SUN_LIGHT (day)"
echo "- Hours 21-22: SUN_SET (dusk)"
echo "- Hours 22-5: SUN_DARK (night)"
echo ""
echo "RESULT: 7 PM will now show 'fading daylight of evening' instead of 'bright midday sun'"
echo ""
echo "Compilation: SUCCESS"
echo "Time-of-day accuracy: FIXED"
echo "Description immersion: IMPROVED"
