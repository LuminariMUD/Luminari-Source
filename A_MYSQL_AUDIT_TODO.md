# MySQL Resource Management Audit Report - Remaining Issues

## Executive Summary
This audit identifies remaining MySQL resource management issues in the LuminariMUD codebase that could lead to memory leaks, connection exhaustion, and database errors.

## Medium Priority Issues

### 1. Global Connection Thread Safety
**Severity**: Medium  
**Frequency**: Depends on threading model  
**Complexity**: Complex fix  

Three global MySQL connections (conn, conn2, conn3) are used throughout without synchronization:

**File**: mysql.c  
**Lines**: 21-23

**Issue**: If the MUD uses threading, simultaneous access to these connections will cause crashes.

**Suggested Fix**: 
- Add mutex protection around all MySQL operations
- Or use connection pooling
- Or ensure single-threaded access

## Low Priority Issues

### 2. Inconsistent Error Handling
**Severity**: Low  
**Frequency**: High  
**Complexity**: Simple fix  

Some functions use exit(1) on MySQL errors while others just log and continue:

**Examples**:
- mysql.c uses exit(1) for connection failures
- Other files just log and return

**Suggested Approach**: Establish consistent error handling policy.

### 3. Missing mysql_real_escape_string() Usage
**Severity**: Low (if input is trusted)  
**Frequency**: Medium  
**Complexity**: Medium fix  

Several queries build SQL directly with sprintf without escaping:

**Files**: Various, including templates.c, objsave.c

**Example**:
```c
snprintf(query, sizeof(query), "SELECT * FROM table WHERE name='%s'", name);
```

**Suggested Fix**:
```c
char escaped_name[MAX_NAME_LENGTH * 2 + 1];
mysql_real_escape_string(conn, escaped_name, name, strlen(name));
snprintf(query, sizeof(query), "SELECT * FROM table WHERE name='%s'", escaped_name);
```

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Fix This Week)
1. Implement proper transaction rollback handling
2. Audit all SQL queries for proper escaping

### Short Term (Fix This Month)
1. Establish connection management best practices
2. Remove redundant NULL checks before mysql_free_result()

### Long Term (Architectural Improvements)
1. Consider connection pooling
2. Implement prepared statements for frequently used queries
3. Add unit tests for database operations
4. Consider abstracting database operations into a separate layer

## Testing Recommendations

After implementing fixes:
1. Run with valgrind to check for memory leaks
2. Monitor MySQL connection count during stress testing
3. Test error conditions (connection loss, query failures)
4. Verify transaction rollback behavior

## Code Review Checklist

When reviewing MySQL code:
- [ ] Every mysql_store_result() has corresponding mysql_free_result()
- [ ] mysql_use_result() fetches ALL rows before freeing
- [ ] No mysql_close() on global connections
- [ ] Transactions have rollback on error
- [ ] User input is escaped with mysql_real_escape_string()
- [ ] Error paths clean up resources
- [ ] mysql_library_end() called only once at program end

## Fixed Issues (Completed 2025-07-28)
- Removed all mysql_close() calls from templates.c (17 occurrences)
- Changed all mysql_use_result() to mysql_store_result() in templates.c
- Fixed disconnect functions to not call mysql_library_end() multiple times
- Added cleanup_mysql_library() function for proper shutdown
- Fixed transaction handling in house.c and objsave.c - added proper rollback on all error paths
- Removed redundant NULL check before mysql_free_result() in account.c
