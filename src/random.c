/* I am bothered by the non-portablility of 'rand' and 'random' -- rand is ANSI
 * C, but on some systems such as Suns, rand has seriously tragic spectral 
 * properties (the low bit alternates between 0 and 1!).  random is better but 
 * isn't supported by all systems.  So, in my quest for portability, I decided 
 * to include this code for a simple but relatively effective random number 
 * generator.  It's not the best RNG code around, but I like it because it's 
 * very short and simple, and for our purposes it's "random enough". -JE */

/* This program is public domain and was written by William S. England. It is

 * The following is a portable c program for generating random numbers. The 
 * modulus and multipilier have been extensively tested and should not be 
 * changed except by someone who is a professional Lehmer generator writer. 
 * THIS GENERATOR REPRESENTS THE MINIMUM STANDARD AGAINST WHICH OTHER 
 * GENERATORS SHOULD BE JUDGED. */
