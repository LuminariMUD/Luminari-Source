#define GOAL_DESCRIPTION ("Character goals are an important part of role playing. A character usually has " \
      "multiple goals, some short term, some mid term and some long term. Sometimes " \
      "these goals are interconnected and sometimes they aren't.  A goal should have " \
      "an objective, a reason for pursuing it and one or more obstacles to achieving " \
      "the goal. A goal should be something achievable, and it should have a consequence " \
      "to failure. Goals can also change as a character grows and progresses. As a character " \
      "achieves or fails at completing their goals, their goals should be adjusted, with some " \
      "potentially removed while other new ones are added. Recording these here in-game helps " \
      "you establish a solid base for role playing your character, and it assists role-play " \
      "staff in helping you in your person role play stories as well as weave you into more " \
      "wide and global narratives. If you're serious about role play, this is well worth your time.")

#define PERSONALITY_DESCRIPTION ("Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart " \
      "from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something " \
      "interesting and fun about your character. They should be self-descriptions that " \
      "are specific about what makes your character stand out. \"I'm smart\" is not a " \
      "good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. \"I've read every book in " \
      "Palanthas\" tells you something specific about your character's interests and " \
      "disposition. " \
      "Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her " \
      "past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's " \
      "self-attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores. " \
      "A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your " \
      "highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either " \
      "one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, " \
      "for example, or be cocky about your high score. ")

#define BONDS_DESCRIPTION ("Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the " \
      "world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to " \
      "heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they " \
      "are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's " \
      "motivations and goals. " \
      "Bonds might answer any of these questions: Whom do you care most about? To what " \
      "place do you feel a special connection? What is your most treasured possession? " \
      "Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some " \
      "other aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain new " \
      "bonds over the course of your adventures. ")

#define IDEALS_DESCRIPTION ("Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental " \
      "moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass " \
      "everything from your life goals to your core belief system. " \
      "Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles that you " \
      "will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives you to " \
      "act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important thing " \
      "you strive for? " \
      "You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good " \
      "place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six " \
      "suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, " \
      "good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular " \
      "background than with moral or ethical perspectives. ")

#define FLAWS_DESCRIPTION ("Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness—in " \
      "particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or " \
      "cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative " \
      "personality traits, a flaw might answer any of these questions: What enrages " \
      "you? What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of? What " \
      "are your vices? ")
