## Quick Start

Get LuminariMUD running in under 2 minutes! Choose the method that works best for you.

### Prerequisites
- Linux/Unix system (Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, WSL, etc.)
- Git installed
- Basic development tools (gcc, make)

### Fastest Setup (Recommended for Beginners)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LuminariMUD/Luminari-Source.git
cd Luminari-Source

# Run the simple setup script
./scripts/simple_setup.sh

# Start the MUD server
./bin/circle -d lib
```

That's it! Connect to `localhost:4000` with any MUD client.

### Automated Setup (More Options)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LuminariMUD/Luminari-Source.git
cd Luminari-Source

# Run deployment with options (no database, minimal world)
./scripts/deploy.sh --auto --skip-db --init-world

# Start the MUD server
./bin/circle -d lib
```

### Standard Setup (With Database)

```bash
# Clone and enter directory
git clone https://github.com/LuminariMUD/Luminari-Source.git
cd Luminari-Source

# Run interactive setup (installs dependencies, configures database, builds)
./scripts/deploy.sh --init-world

# Start the server (if start_mud.sh was created)
./start_mud.sh
# Or directly:
./bin/circle -d lib
```

### Manual Build (Advanced Users)

```bash
# Copy required configuration files
cp src/campaign.example.h src/campaign.h
cp src/mud_options.example.h src/mud_options.h
cp src/vnums.example.h src/vnums.h

# Build with autotools
make clean && make -j$(nproc)

# Copy minimal world files
for dir in zon wld mob obj shp trg qst hlq; do
    mkdir -p lib/world/${dir}
    cp lib/world/minimal/index.${dir} lib/world/${dir}/index 2>/dev/null || true
    cp lib/world/minimal/*.${dir} lib/world/${dir}/ 2>/dev/null || true
done
echo '$' > lib/world/hlq/index

# Run the MUD
./bin/circle -d lib
```

### Deployment Options

The `deploy.sh` script supports various options:
- `--quick` - Skip all prompts, use defaults
- `--skip-db` - Skip database setup (MySQL optional)
- `--skip-deps` - Skip dependency installation
- `--init-world` - Initialize minimal world data
- `--dev` - Development build with debug symbols
- `--prod` - Production optimized build

### Next Steps

1. Connect with a MUD client to `localhost:4000`
2. Create your first character
3. Explore the commands with `help`
4. See admin documentation in `docs/admin/`
5. Start building your world!

For detailed installation and configuration, see the [Installation](#installation) section below.

                        libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev mariadb-server git make cmake \
                        autoconf automake libtool pkg-config

# HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: Install debugging tools (used by debug_game.sh and vgrind.sh)
sudo apt-get install -y gdb valgrind
```

### Build and Run
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/LuminariMUD/Luminari-Source.git
cd Luminari-Source

# Configure required headers (one-time setup)

cmake --build build/ -j$(nproc)

# Option 2: Traditional build with Autotools
autoreconf -fvi  # Only if configure script missing
./configure
make

# Run the server (after configuration)
bin/circle

# Or use the autorun script for automatic restarts
./autorun
```

## Installation

For detailed installation instructions including system requirements, dependencies, database setup, and configuration, please see the **[Setup and Build Guide](docs/guides/SETUP_AND_BUILD_GUIDE.md)**.

Windows users (WSL): See the "Auto-WSL integration (Windows)" section in the Setup and Build Guide for targeting a specific WSL distro and for temporarily disabling or re-enabling the Auto-WSL behavior.


## Usage

### Basic Commands

#### Building and Development
```bash
# Build everything
make all

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Clean autotools files (keeps Makefile & config.h)
