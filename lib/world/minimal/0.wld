The Void~
   You drift in formless darkness, suspended between creation and oblivion.
The air is still, the silence absolute, and only a faint shimmer in the
distance suggests the way back to the mortal world.

Arrival Platform~
   You stand upon a polished stone dais suspended within featureless
darkness.  A faint silver glow marks the outline of an archway to the
east, its light promising passage deeper into the world.  A rune-etched
obelisk beside the arch hums softly, resonating with the latent magic
that sustains this staging point between realms.

Hall of Beginnings~
   Starlight spills across a circular chamber whose floor resembles a
tranquil pool of midnight glass.  Sigils marking the paths of mortal
journeys glow along the walls, while a gentle breeze whispers of distant
adventures.  Paths lead west toward the arrival platform and east toward
the immortal nexus.

Immortal Nexus~
   Smooth marble pillars rise into the darkness above, each crowned with
a floating crystal that sheds a calm, steady light.  A mosaic of the
world's continents gleams underfoot, centered around a silver dais where
immortals gather to watch over the realms.  A softly glowing doorway lies
to the west, returning to the Hall of Beginnings.
