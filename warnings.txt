Summary of attempts to fix all compilation warnings:

1. Created a todo list to track the tasks:
   - Run make clean to remove all build artifacts
   - Run make all to build everything
   - Fix any compilation warnings that appear

2. Successfully ran 'make clean' to clean the build directory

3. Attempted to run 'make all' and capture warnings:
   - First attempt: make all 2>&1 | tee build_output.txt
   - Tried to grep for warnings but the output was truncated

4. Attempted to search for warnings in the build output:
   - grep -E "(warning:|error:)" build_output.txt | head -50
   - This returned no output

5. Tried to rebuild and capture warnings more directly:
   - make clean && make all 2>&1 | grep -i "warning" | head -50
   - This showed many warnings but output was truncated

6. Attempted to count total warnings:
   - make clean && make all 2>&1 | grep -i "warning" | wc -l
   - This showed the warnings in the terminal but the count showed as 0

7. Tried to save warnings to a file:
   - make clean && make all 2>&1 | grep -i "warning:" > warnings.txt
   - The warnings.txt file was created but remained empty (0 bytes)

8. Final attempt to build and count warnings:
   - make all 2>&1 | tee build_full.log | grep -c "warning:"
   - This was interrupted by the user

Issues encountered:
- Output redirection wasn't capturing the warnings properly
- The grep commands weren't saving to files as expected
- The build output was very long and kept getting truncated

The build process clearly shows many warnings including:
- Unused variables
- Implicit function declarations (missing #include <time.h> in many files)
- Type conversion warnings
- Unused but set variables
- Statement with no effect warnings
- Array bounds warnings in crafting_new.c

To properly fix all warnings, I would need to:
1. Address missing includes (especially <time.h>)
2. Remove or use unused variables
3. Fix type conversions and casts
4. Fix array bounds issues
5. Remove statements with no effect
