 * SUBRACE_ these are subraces for NPC's, currently set to maximum 3, some
 *          mechanics such as resistances are built into these (ex: fire, goblinoid)
 * PC_SUBRACE_ these are subraces for PC's, only used for animal shapes spell
 *             currently, use to be part of the wildshape system (need to phase this out)
 * RACE_TYPE_ this is like the family the race belongs to, like an iron golem

Whilst the region is best known for it's wide and verdant plains, it also has a number of city states dotted throughout. Those from Abanasinia are called Abanasinian.";
    case REGION_BALIFOR: return "When the Cataclysm struck Balifor, much of the southern regions of the nation crumbled and sank into the ocean, killing many thousands. The kender and other beings more inland were able to escape death. Since the Cataclysm, the land turned into a hot desert wasteland, and most kender decided to pack up and founded Kendermore to the east instead. Humans dominate the land there now, with most living in cities or as nomads in the desert. In the winter of 348 AC - 349 AC, the Black Dragonarmy invaded Balifor, quickly seizing and taking control of the lands. ";
    case REGION_BLODE: return "Following the Cataclysm, the ogres of Blode moved down and started claiming land around the Khalkist Mountains. They established a principality to the west of the Khalkist Mountains, naming it Blodehelm (which translates into Common as 'Home of Blode'). The rich and fertile plains initially became the agricultural center of the region, however the arrival of human warlords from the Plains of Dust, forced a bloody conflict between the warlords and the ogres. Ultimately the warlords and the ogres drew up a pact, in which the warlords claimed Blodehelm for themselves and the ogres remained in their mountainous home of Blode. During the War of the Lance, Blode sided with the Nerakans and the Queen of Darkness in fighting Paladine's forces of good. They were not hoping to get right into the fighting right away, but were hoping they could take over Silvanesti due to the elves being an age-old enemy. They also provided a lot of food and supplies from Blodehelm to keep the Dragonarmies marching.";
    case REGION_BLOOD_SEA_ISLES: return "Blood Sea Isles are located off the northeastern coast of Ansalon. They were formed from the lands of the Empire of Istar, including Falthana, Gather, Midrath, and Seldjuk. Almost everyone that lives in the Isles is a mariner of some sort, from the smallest fisherman to the mightiest admirals of the Minotaur Empire. The people make a living ranging from fishing and hauling cargo to being a privateer and making war. Also known as the Blood Sea Isles, these islands are the home of sea barbarians and minotaur. Legend states that when the firey mountain struck Krynn, these islands survived because of their innocence of the guilt of Istar. More likely, however, is the fact that these islands were originally part of the coastal islands bordering on the Courrain Ocean, and survived due to their altitude. Saifhum is the home of many sea barbarians, and not much else. The rocky highlands do not sport much in the form of anything living. The only real evidence of civilization is the capital, Sea Reach, which lies on the southwest shore of the island. Saifhum is the western most island of the four. Karthay is the largest island is also furthest north, and is shaped somewhat like a crescent moon. The dry plains in the eastern and western portions of the island are interrupted only by high peaks, known as the Worldscap Mountains. The only evidence of civilization is Winston's Tower-a ruined lighthouse. Mithas lies directly to the south of Karthay, and is one of the minotaur isles. Along the southern shore of the island are four volcanic peaks, a sharp contrast to the rest of the island's grassy plains. The capital of Lacynos (Nethosak) lies on the western shores, and is sheltered from the ravages of the Blood Sea by the Horned Bay. Though it does not have the volcanic problem of its northern neighbor, Kothas doesn't have the vegetation to make up for it. Minotaur rule this island, along with human pirates who live in the capital of Kalpethis. Kothas lies to the south of Mithas, and Kalpethis lies on the southwestern shores of the island.";
    case REGION_ENSTAR: return "Enstar is a human island located south of Southern Ergoth, west of Qualinesti, and northwest of Nostar. Its major geographical features are the Sirrion Sea on its western and southern border, with the Straits of Algoni to the east of it. The island is mostly flat grassland.";
    case REGION_ESTWILDE: return "Estwilde is a mostly-human tribal nation that covers a long and narrow region stretching from Kalaman Bay in the absolute northern reaches of Ansalon, and then spreading downwards and ending at the New Sea in the central part of the continent of Ansalon. The region is bordered by Lemish, Throt and Nightlund on its western border, Taman Busuk on its eastern side, and Nordmaar on its northeast border. The humans of Estwilde are split between the natives who hail from the Lor-Tai tribe, the cannibals of the Lahutian tribe, the wild mountain barbarians of Estwilde, and the civilised folk of the South Shore. Most outsiders deal with the mountain barbarians, who offer themselves as foot soldiers and mercenaries to those with enough money to hire their services. In the early years following the Cataclysm, Estwilde was often where skirmishes and border fights were played out between the forces of Solamnia and those of Taman Busuk. During the War of the Lance, the Dragonarmies invaded the Estwilde region from Taman Busuk, quickly conquering the realm and turning it into an ally to the dark armies. The invasion really didn't affect the people of the land much, and the Dragonarmies used the land to build up and train their forces, while launching attacks upon Solamnia.";
    case REGION_GOODLUND: return "Goodlund is located east of Balifor, south of the Minotaur Empire, and southeast of Khur. The geographical features of the lands are the Blood Sea of Istar, which borders the northern coast and the Southern Courrain Ocean on the south and east. The forests of Wendle Woods and Beast's Run are located on the west and southern portion of the land, while the rivers Lifesbreath and Heartsblood lead out into The Maw. Furthermore, several prominent geographical features are located along the coastline, including the Writhing Wreck, Habbakuk's Necklace, the Restless Waters, Thunderhead, Boiler's Bay, Churning Reach, Mistlestraits, Land's End, and the Sombre Coast. During the War of the Lance, the White Dragonarmy invaded Goodlund in the winter of 348 AC - 349 AC. The dragonarmy's intention was to isolate the kender of Kendermore, while the evil creatures of the Laughing Lands have either allied with the White Wing or were impressed into the army's service. The Dairly Plains are the only area of Goodlund that withstood the dragonarmy's advance and continued its resistence throughout the war.";
    case REGION_HYLO: return "Hylo is a kender nation that is located north of Northern Ergoth and Sikk'et Hul with the Straits of Algoni to the east. Before the Cataclysm, Hylo was located near the Empire of Ergoth's provinces of the Eastern Hundred and the Mountain Hundred. The kender from Hylo are called Hyloian. The forests of the land are temperate year round, very little snow falls in the winter months except for a few flurries. In order to become the leader of Hylo for a year, you must win some sort of contest on Election Day, which could involve spitting seeds, who can swim the fastest, or even stand on your head the longest. While the War of the Lance raged across Ansalon, the kender of Hylo were completely unaware that a war was even going on. Some tales were brought to the kender about a war, but most thought it was just a good story. The goblins of Sikk'et Hul pledged an alliance with both Hylo and Northern Ergoth during this time.";
    case REGION_KAYOLIN: return "Kayolin, sometimes spelled Kaolyn, is a dwarven kingdom that is set in the peaks of the Garnet Mountains and is bordered by Solamnia on its northern, southern and western sides, and Lemish to the east. A small number of towns and fortifications are readily visible in the mountain range, but the large cities of Kayolin are all based underground beneath the mountains. Kayolin is populated by the Hylar, Daewar, Neidar and Aghar dwarves, who trade and deal openly with humans and merchants of other races. The realm of Kayolin is a peaceful one that does not have the clan fighting that is contained in the other kingdoms of the dwarves, and is ruled by a single nominated governor. The Cataclysm severed the close ties that Kayolin had with Thorbardin, with the New Sea creating a gap between the two dwarven kingdoms. The smaller kingdom learnt to survive on its own and boosted their production of metals and manufactured goods, becoming the primary supplier of these components for northern Ansalon. The dwarves of Kayolin then formed an alliance with the Knights of Solamnia in keeping the forces of Lemish at bay, and forced strengthened the relationship with their human neighbours in Solamnia.";
    case REGION_KHUR: return "Khur is a Human nomadic nation that is located southeast of Taman Busuk, northeast of Blöde, west of the Ogrelands, north of Silvanesti, and east of Thoradin. It is a mountainous and desert region with scattered oases & shrubs that are usually controlled by one of the Khur tribes there. Geographical features include the Khalkist Mountains in the west and north, the Burning Lands in southern Khur, and the Khurman Sea on the southeastern border. The nation is led by the Khan of Khur and inhabited by the seven tribes which form the Nomads of Khur. The people of Khur love their horses, and are known for breeding the best in all of Ansalon. Races are held between the tribes to prove which breeds the best and wagers are placed on the outcomes. Khur came into being after the Cataclysm struck Krynn. A leader by the name of Keja united all the tribes together into one nation. He had seven sons who, after his death, vied for power and ended up splitting the nation into seven different tribes. Over time this area has bred hardy warriors from the desert. During the War of the Lance, the Green Dragonarmy was invited into Khur for their war on Ansalon. They began seizing the cities and water sources until a Khurish warrior named Salah-Khan became the next head of the Green Dragonarmy. After the War of the Lance, the Green Dragonarmy was no longer in Khur.";

Its major geographical features are the Southern Dargaard Mountains on its eastern border, Godsfell Woods on the northeast corner, the Darkwoods are a large forest that take up most of the land, and the Garnet Mountains on its southwestern border with Solamnia. Seventy-five percent of the land is covered in thick forests. The Great Seven Gods Highway brought a lot of trade through Lemish prior to the Cataclysm. It entered into Lemish from the south and went east to Sanction. At least one Grand Master even hailed from this Solamnic province in 1634 PC by the name of Gregori uth Telan. The nation was ruled by the Dictator of Lemish. Following the Cataclysm Lemish was completely cut off from Ergoth, and built port cities to capitalize on the sudden appearance of the Newsea at their southern border. The Lemish people continued to blame the Solamnics to the north, while they just tried to survive. Solamnia has tried to annex Lemish multiple times after the Cataclysm, yet have continually been driven back by the Lemish natives. At one point the Lemish goaded the Nerakans and the Solamnics into a war that lasted fifty years. These became known as the Nerakan Wars. During the War of the Lance, Lemish allied with the forces of the Dark Queen in order to be able to attack Solamnia. Their forces led the attacks against Garnet, Caergoth, and Solanthus, but were repelled from invading Kayolin.";
    case REGION_NIGHTLUND: return "Nightlund is a Human land that shares its western border with Solamnia. Nightlund is north of both Lemish and Throt, west of Estwilde, and southwest of Nordmaar. Major geographical features include the Dargaard Mountains on the eastern border with Estwilde, and the Vingaard River which runs the length of Nightlund's western border and north to Kalaman. There is a large forested land of cypress trees west of the Dargaard Mountains called \"The Grove\". Heavily wooded and mountainous, the land was never suitable for farming. Even before the Cataclysm, it was only sparsely populated. In the time following the Cataclysm, Knightlund was renamed to Nightlund for the perpetual twilight that shrouds the land, even during the daytime. The Cataclysm was particularly devastating to this region of Ansalon. The mountains were split by earthquakes, the river overflowed and shifted course, destroying most of the settlements. It was known as a place of disease and plagues, killing the inhabitants of the land. The roads and bridges were similarly destroyed and eventually reclaimed by nature. By the time of the War of the Lance, only outlaws choose to live here.";
    case REGION_NORDMAAR: return "Nordmaar is a human nomadic nation that is located northeast of Estwilde, north of Taman Busuk, in northeastern Ansalon. The north and east of the realm is bordered by the Northern Courrain Ocean with the Last Coast being on the northeastern side, whilst the Turbidus Ocean lies on the western side of Nordmaar. A few of the major geographical features are The Great Moors, the Southern Wastes, the Sahket Jungle, the Emerald Peaks, The Horseman and the Fountain of Renewal. The northern part of the land is tropical with many rainforests and jungles, but as you go farther south towards Taman Busuk, it is more arid. The humans of the realm are split between various tribes and are further factioned between the Nordmen of the cities, who all offer fealty to a single king, who resides in North Keep, and the Horselords, who loyally serve the Khan of the Southern Wastes. Prior to 348 AC Nordmaar had only fought one known war, the War of the Sky, against the Knights of Solamnia in 202 AC. After the war, Nordmaar and Solamnia forged an alliance that remains to this day. During the War of the Lance, the Red Dragonarmy invaded, taking over all of Nordmaar. The Nordmen were quickly subjugated by their enemy, however the Horselords maintained a steady fight, which resulted in large losses for the nomadic humans. ";

Northern Ergoth shares its northern border with the kender nation of Hylo and its southern border with the goblin province of Sikk'et Hul. The major geographical features of the island are the Sirrion Sea that surrounds the island, the Sentinel Mountains that serve as a border between Northern Ergoth and Hylo, and Raekel's Pit located in the southern crook of the Sentinel Mountains. The lands of Northern Ergoth are mostly grasslands and coastal plains with the province of Sikk'et Hul a desert of hills and scrubland. The people of the land are usually dark-skinned seagoing people, with large fishing vessels. Rice paddies are common on the island. The island's armies are organized into legions. During the War of the Lance the dragonarmies made attempts to invade Northern Ergoth but were driven back from the island.";

Nostar is roughly 60 miles east to west and 40 miles north to south. It is an island of large grasslands, forests, and rolling hills, mostly inhabited by goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears in the interior, with a few humans and elves living close to the coastline. The geographical features of this island are a rock formation known as the Three Brothers, located on the eastern part of the island, and an unnamed egg-shaped lake in the center of the island. Nostar was also known for a type of black wine that was produced on the island.";
    case REGION_QUALINESTI: return "Qualinesti, one of the prominent elven nations on Ansalon, was a realm of great beauty and grace. Nestled deep within the towering forests of the continent of Ansalon, Qualinesti was home to the Qualinesti Elves, a subrace of the elven people known for their wisdom, refinement, and dedication to preserving the natural world. The nation was ruled by the Speaker of the Suns, who was both a political leader and a spiritual guide for the elves. The capital city, Qualinost, was a breathtaking sight, featuring intricately designed treetop cities and bridges, emphasizing the elves' close connection to the forest. The elven architecture was a testament to their harmony with nature, as they sought to coexist with the land rather than dominate it. During the War of the Lance, Qualinesti found itself in a perilous situation as it faced the threat of the dragonarmies of Takhisis. Despite their commitment to neutrality and peace, the Qualinesti Elves were forced to defend their homeland against the advancing armies. The war had a profound impact on Qualinesti, testing the elves' strength, determination, and their relationship with their neighboring elven nation, Silvanesti. Qualinesti's resilience and the sacrifices made by its people during this tumultuous time became emblematic of the elven spirit and their enduring connection to the land they cherished.";
    case REGION_SANCRIST_ISLE: return "The Isle of Sancrist is the westernmost landmass of all of Ansalon. It is located west of Northern Ergoth and north and northwest of Cristyne in the Sirrion Sea. The isle is considered to have two sections: Gunthar and Sancrist. The Sancrist area has many mountain ranges, including the Gargath Mountains, the Majestic Mountains, the Numbered Mountains, the Skyfisher Range, the Sun Range, and the Caves of Pyrothraxus. The Gunthar section of Sancrist Isle has the Whitestone River which leads from the Whitestone Glade to Thalan Bay. It is where the Whitestone Council was held that united the forces of good against the evil Dragonarmies, and it also is home to Mount Nevermind, the peculiar mountain-city of most gnomes who call Krynn home.";
    case REGION_SCHALLSEA: return "Schallsea is an island east of Abanasinia. It is, for the most part, populated by humans. It is located in Newsea, separated from Abanasinia in by the Straits of Schallsea. Schallsea is about 200 miles long and 80 miles wide. Schallsea has a large croup of hills called the Barren Hills in the center, dividing it roughly in half. Schallsea also has a number of streams. Schallsea did not exist prior to the Cataclysm, it was formed when Newsea flooded the lands in the middle of Ansalon. The Blue Dragonarmies fought the Que-Nal, a group of people on the island, on Schallsea.";
    case REGION_SILVANESTI: return "The original elven kingdom in Ansalon, from where the Kagonesti and Qualinesti elves probably came. Holding capital at Silvanost, this kingdom is famous for its marble buildings, garden-like forests and the towers of Eru at the mouths of the Thon-Thalas. The Cataclysm ended Istar's dominance over the world. After the disaster, Silvanesti sent out scouts to report the damage done to their nation. The effects of the Cataclysm had been catastrophic. Blaming the disaster upon the humans, the elves remained in their kingdom and continued to remain isolated from the world. In 349 AC, Silvanesti was drawn into the War of the Lance. First negotiating a peace with the great Dragonarmies, the elves were soon betrayed. The dark forces turned south and into the woodland border. Knowing his nation's destruction was imminent, the elven King Lorac used a dragon orb that he had rescued from Istar prior to the empire's destruction. While the population of Silvanesti fled south and west out of the nation, the king tried to drive the invading armies and dragons out of the land. Unable to control the power of the Dragonorb, the artifact instead took control of King Lorac and threw the nation of Silvanesti into a nightmare state. The forest and everyone in it became twisted into an evil mockery of what they once were. Seeing the elven nation warping before their very eyes, the Dragonarmies quickly retreated out of the nation desperately trying to reach safety. For thirty long years, the refugees of Silvanesti would remain without a homeland. While the majority of the population lived at Silvamori on Southern Ergoth, the rest worked hard to try and destroy the nightmare that plagued their lands.";
    case REGION_SOLAMNIA: return "Solamnia is a human nation in northwestern Ansalon. Solamnia has just about every geographical feature: fertile plains, three mountain ranges (the Vingaard Mountains, Dargaard Mountains and the Garnet Mountains), the longest river, the Vingaard River, and the Northern Wastes. Not a perfectly flat land, has ridges, gullies, dry creek beds, small stands of trees, mostly a grassy steppe land. People from Solamnia are referred to as being Solamnic or Solamnian and they speak Solamnic or some of the Knights speak Old Solamnic. Slavery is outlawed in Solamnia, and if you are caught having slaves, the punishment is very severe. Solamnia's chief exports are grain and cattle. The provinces that make up Solamnia are Coastlund in the west, Palanthas east of that, Hinterlund on the border with Nightlund, Plains of Solamnia also on the border with Nightlund, Elkholm and Heartlund south of Plains of Solamnia, and Southlund southwest of Heartlund. In Southlund, in the area are Caergoth, the area is known for very violent thunderstorms. From Coastlund in the west, to Hinterlund in the east, live a variety of people—mostly humans, but small bands of ogres and draconians are far too common. Originally located in the center of the Ansalonian continent, Solamnia is now very much a sea-going state because the Cataclysm dumped three oceans around its borders. In the years following the Cataclysm, the commoners of Solamnia blame the Knights of Solamnia for the Cataclysm. Some Knights go into hiding while others throw down their sword and armor to leave the Knighthood forever. These are the dark ages for Solamnia and the Knighthood. In the year 334 AC, peasants led by Ragnell revolted against the nation, leading to the destruction of some major castles and death to a few prominent Solamnic families. In the year 351 AC, Dragonarmies invade eastern Solamnia, quickly overrunning the Knights of Solamnia there and pushing them all the way to the High Clerist's Tower by 352 AC. Solamnia is also betrayed and Dragonarmies are allowed to invade from the south, but thanks to Solamnia's allies of the Kayolin dwarves, the dwarves are able to hold the invaders until the Knights could regroup and hold the Dragonarmies in the south in a stalemate.";
    case REGION_SOUTHERN_ERGOTH: return "Southern Ergoth is an island located west of Ansalon and south of Northern Ergoth that was created when the Cataclysm tore Ergoth in two. Southern Ergoth stretches about 250 miles from north to south. The major geographical features of Southern Ergoth are the Sirrion Sea that surrounds the island, the Straits of Algoni that separate it from Ansalon, Morgash Lake which is just north of the capital city of Daltigoth, the Last Gaard Mountains running down the center of Southern Ergoth with Foghaven Vale in the mountains, Harkun Bay on the southern coastline, Plains of Tothen located in the southwestern coastline, Plains of Kri on the southern coastline, and the River Ergot located in the northeast. In the years following the Cataclysm, Southern Ergoth has had a close working relationship with Northern Ergoth, trying to restore the Empire. Southern Ergoth has been ruled from Daltigoth by regents appointed by the Redic Dynasty. The forests of Southern Ergoth became the homeland for the Kagonesti Elves. During the War of the Lance, the elves of Qualinesti and Silvanesti moved their people to Southern Ergoth to escape from the invading Dragonarmies. They enslaved the Kagonesti to build them cities while in exile. ";
    case REGION_TAMAN_BUSUK: return "Taman Busuk is the melting pot for all the 'evil' races of Ansalon. This region contains three of the most important dark cities: Sanction, Neraka, and Gargath. Taman Busuk borders the Estwilde and Kern in the north and Zhakar in the south. For the most part, Taman Busuk is a mountainous region, with the exception of the wastelands located in the south. The Khalkists are broken in few places, most notable Godshome and Gargath. As a state, Taman Busuk is very weak, but the cities within it are much more important.";
    case REGION_TARSIS: return "The small nation of Tarsis is centred around the great trade city of the same name. In the Pre-Cataclius Ansalon, Tarsis was a respected Lordcity of the realm, which was located in the forested region to the east of Kharolis and the west of the Silvanesti nation. The minor town and settlements around Tarsis all benefited with the large trade that the lordcity did with the other nations. However the Cataclysm resulted in the Lordcity of Tarsis becoming landlocked in the newly risen Plains of Dust. The nation once known as Tarsis ceased to exist at this point, and the city of Tarsis became little more than a dusty husk of it's former self that was considered part of this arid realm.";
    case REGION_TEYR: return "Teyr is a draconian nation located south of Nordmaar, north of Busuk Taman, and east of Estwilde. It is a mountainous region that has heavy forested lands, and some northern grasslands. The Astivar Mountains are in Teyr, while the Woods of Lahue are west of it. The Great Moors are to the east of it. Mount Brego is located west of the city of Teyr, in the Astivar Mountains, with the Peak of Destiny as the southernmost peak.";
    case REGION_THORBARDIN: return "Thorbardin is a dwarven nation located in southwestern Ansalon and is bordered by the nations of Qualinesti to the north, Plains of Dust to the east, and Kharolis to the south. The major geographical features of Thorbardin is the Kharolis Mountains which is most of the nation, the Plains of Dergoth which is a barren wasteland, the Urkhan Sea which is located inside of Thorbardin, and the Valley of Thanes. The Dwarven realm of Thorbardin not only refers to the kingdom under Cloudseeker Mountain, but also much of the land surrounding the Kharolis Mountains. During the War of the Lance in 351 AC, Thorbardin is besieged by Highlord Verminaard and his Red Dragonarmy at the northern gate. They are never able to gain access to Thorbardin. But a small band called the Companions leading the Refugees of Pax Tharkas are allowed entry into the kingdom for a time. During that time, the Companions find the Hammer of Kharas that had been thought lost since the Dwarfgate War many years ago. After finding it, they give it to Glade Hornfel Kytil who becomes the first King of Thorbardin since the Dwarfgate War.";

Shrewd traders and ruthless in business, Amnians believe that the end of a successful transaction is justified by any means, ethical or otherwise. Although the nation is richer by far than even the northern metropolises of Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep, its influence is curtailed by the unwillingness of its rulers to work together in the nation's best interest. The members of the Council of Five are fairly unified and tight-fisted in their control of Amn, but their ability to affect events outside their own borders is limited because they can't agree enough on major matters of foreign policy. The oligarchs utterly control their nation, but beyond the areas that each rules, their families and businesses compete with one another and with the locals of far-flung places.\r\n\r\n"
           "The use of arcane magic is illegal in Amn, meaning that the only authorized spellcasters in the nation are wielders of divine magic who enjoy the support and patronage of a temple, and users of arcane magic who have been given special dispensation by one of the oligarchs. So pervasive is the sway of Amn's oligarchy that few crimes merit physical punishment but those that involve the use of arcane magic or an offense against one of the council's merchant houses. Other infractions are forgiven after the miscreant makes payment of an appropriate fine.";

After years of struggling beneath their genasi masters, human slaves arose to follow a Chosen of Ilmater, at first using nonviolent resistance, and then erupting in full rebellion following his disappearance. They overthrew the genie lords of Calimport and Memnon, casting the remaining genies out of the cities and back to their elemental homes or into the depths of the deserts.\r\n\r\n"
           "Much of Calimshan is a chaotic place dominated by wealth, political influence, and personal power. Many pray for the return of the Chosen and the completion of his work. Others are learning to live together without genie masters, and to grudgingly accept the remaining genasi among them.";
  case REGION_CHULT:
    return "The vast, choking jungles of Chult hide what many believe to be great mineral wealth, including large gemstones and veins of ore. Poisonous flora and fauna riddle the jungles, but some still brave the dangers to seek their fortunes. Some of the exotic plants that grow only in Chult fetch high prices in mainland markets. Ruined Mezro stands across the sea from Calimshan, waiting for explorers and its displaced people to cleanse the city of its undead inhabitants and uncover the treasures that lie hidden there.\r\n\r\n"
           "Eastward along the Chultan peninsula lie the remains of Thindol and Samarach. Despite the apparent fall of both civilizations, Thindol remains infested with yuan-ti, while the illusions cloaking Samarach's mountain passes conceal the activities in that nation.";
  case REGION_DAMBRATH:
    return "Situated on a warm plain on the shore of the Great Sea, Dambrath is ruled by nomadic clans of human horse riders who revere Silvanus, Malar, and occasionally Selune. Given the Dambrathans' history of domination by the Crinti, a ruling caste of half-drow, it is no surprise that they reserve their greatest hatred for the drow.\r\n\r\n"
           "The clans meet twice a year at a sacred site known as the Hills of the Kings, where dozens of totem sculptures are preserved. At these gatherings, each clan updates its totem with an account of its exploits over the previous seasons. Many Dambrathans seek out lycanthropy as a means of showing reverence for their favored deity and honoring their heritage.";

The tribes of xenophobic elves that claim this area don't hesitate to discourage uninvited guests by any means necessary. A simple group of pilgrims might be scared off with some arrows, while a band of hunters or explorers is likely to be killed outright.\r\n\r\n"
           "Food is sparse in this region, with the forests long since vanished, and as a result the elves of Elfharrow fiercely protect the herds of animals they have cultivated. The elves have no interest in looting the cities of fallen Lapaliiya, but neither are they willing to allow 'adventurers' free access to those lands through their territory.";
  case REGION_HALRUAA:
    return "Once believed destroyed in the conflagration of the Spellplague, Halruaa has largely been restored to the insular, magic-mighty nation it once was. Because of the foresight of their divinations, Halruaan wizards were able to use the raging blue fire that followed Mystra's death to propel their nation safely into the realm of Toril's twin, Abeir (displacing part of that world into the Plane of Shadow).\r\n\r\n"

Around its perimeter is a conglomeration of city-states and minor baronies typified by the shifting domains known as the Border Kingdoms. Here, along the southern shore of the lake, explorers and fortune seekers squander their amassed wealth building castles, founding communities, and drawing loyal vassals to them - only to have all those good works disappear within a generation or two. In some cases, one of these realms is fortunate to be saved from its inevitable decline by another group of successful adventurers, who inject enough wealth and wisdom to keep the enterprise going a few more decades.";

A realm of humans living in harmony with their elf and half-elf neighbors, Aglarond has been a foe of Thay for centuries, in part due to the temperament of its former ruler, the Simbul. The nation is now ruled by a Simbarch Council, which has backed away from open hostilities with Thay. With the restoration of the Weave, the ongoing changes to the political landscape, and calls for elven independence within the nation, it is unclear what sort of place Aglarond will be in a generation's time, except that its potential for great change will be realized.";
  case REGION_CHESSENTA:

Each city boasts its own heroes, worships its own gladiatorial champions, and spends as much time insulting and competing with the other cities as it does on any other activity. The city of Luthcheq is dominated by worship of the bizarre deity known as Entropy, while Erebos is ruled by the latest incarnation of the red dragon known as Tchazzar the Undying. Heptios contains the largest library in Chessenta, a center of learning where all nobles aspire to send their children for tutoring. That city is looked on with disdain by the people of Akanax, whose militant contempt for the 'fat philosophers' of Heptios is widely known. Toreus welcomes all visitors, even those from lands that are despised or mistrusted, and foreign coin can buy nearly anything there. The floating city of Airspur still flies somehow, its earthmotes unaffected by the fall of its fellows when the Sundering came to a close.";
  case REGION_CORMYR:

A strong realm bolstered by its loyal army (the Purple Dragons), a cadre of magical defenders and investigators (the War Wizards), and numerous wealthy and influential nobles, Cormyr is recovering from its war with Sembia and Netheril - a conflict that cost the nation much, but left the kingdom standing, and which, in the end, Netheril didn't survive. The pride of that victory remains strong in Cormyr's collective consciousness, even as Queen Raedra draws back from plans to permanently welcome into the realm towns that lie beyond Cormyr's traditional borders.\r\n"
           "Cormyreans are justly proud of their homeland, and go to great lengths to guard it and its honor. Still, there is no shortage of danger in the Forest Kingdom, whether from scheming, treacherous nobles, monsters out of the Hullack Forest or the Stonelands, or some ancient, hidden magic. Cormyr is many things, but dull isn't one of them.";

Few outside the region have much interest in what goes on here, except for those in the immediately surrounding lands, who fear a resurgence of the ancient evils of the region - though they aren't fearful enough to do more than send an adventuring party or two into the area to investigate.\r\n\r\n"
           "In Damara, the usurper King Yarin Frostmantle sits on the throne of the Dragonbane dynasty, while his people complain about his tyranny and the growing threat from demons across the country. In Narfell, skilled riders and archers hunt, raid, and are gradually reclaiming their heritage as a great nation of mages who treated with devils. The Warlock Knights of Vaasa threaten to break the bounds of their nation and invade Damara, the Moonsea, or both, while some of its members suspiciously eye the ominously silent Castle Perilous, perhaps planning another excursion to the place. The tiny nation of Sossal trades with its neighbors, but shares little of itself with the wider world.";

They take great pride in their peaceful coexistence with the elves of Cormanthor, and in their ability to remain largely self-sufficient and autonomous even when their homeland was used as a battlefield by Cormyr, Netheril, Sembia, and Myth Drannor in the recent conflicts. Featherdale and Tasseldale have reasserted their independence since the end of the war, and rejoined Archendale, Battledale, Daggerdale, Deepingdale, Harrowdale, Mistledale, Scardale, and Shadowdale on the Dales Council. The High Dale did the same shortly afterward.\r\n\r\n"

After these tribesfolk were defeated, some of the fierce, mounted warriors who survived the conflict gathered to form the small nation of Yaïmunnahar. Some others cling to the old ways, mastering the sword and the bow and riding across the steppes on their short-legged horses. Brave merchants still traverse the Golden Way to and from Kara-Tur, but those who return from such a voyage are fewer than they once were.";
  case REGION_IMPILTUR:

           "Impiltur is a nation of humans with pockets of dwarves and halflings among its populace.

  case REGION_THE_MOONSEA:
    return "The shores of the Moonsea have long been home to cities that rise swiftly, relying on vigorous trade and gathering powerful mercenaries to their banners, only to overextend themselves and fall - sometimes crumbling over time, and sometimes dropping like stones from the sky.\r\n\r\n"
           "Now that Netheril and Myth Drannor have fallen, those two great powers can no longer exert their influence over the Moonsea, allowing the city of Hillsfar to spread its wings and eye southward expansion, and Mulmaster to once again further the worship of Bane. Phlan, Teshwave, Thentia, and Voonlar - all Moonsea cities where greater powers jockeyed for influence - now work to find their own identities before an unchecked or malevolent realm swallows them, one by one.\r\n\r\n"

Its deities manifested fully in the forms of some of their descendants, and swiftly rallied the Mulan to overthrow the Imaskari. Aided by the mighty wizard Nezram, known as the World-Walker, the Mulhorandi overthrew the rulers of High Imaskar, who fled into the Plains of Purple Dust or to extraplanar safeholds.\r\n\r\n"
           "When the upheaval ended and the Chosen began to disappear, the gods of Mulhorand remained to rule their people, focusing their attention on defending their restored homeland to keep the war in Unther and Tymanther from spilling over its borders. For the first time in centuries, the people in Mulhorand are free, with the gods declaring that slavery shall no longer be practiced among the Mulan since their return.";
  case REGION_RASHEMEN:

It is ruled by its Iron Lord, Mangan Uruk, who speaks for the power behind the throne: the Wychlaran, the society of masked witches that determine Rashemen's course. These witches wield great powers tied to the land and its magic and guard against evil fey and vengeful spirits. A small number of male spellcasters, known as the Old Ones, create magic items and weave arcane rituals for the witches. Rashemi witches revere the Three, a triumvirate of goddesses they call Bhalla (the Den Mother), Khelliara (the Forest Maiden), and the Hidden One. Over the centuries, scholars in other lands have speculated that these deities might be faces of Chauntea, Mielikki, and Mystra, respectively.\r\n\r\n"
           "The nation's warriors are a fierce, stoic lot, famed for their strength, endurance, and stubbornness in battle. Rashemen is a long-standing enemy of Thay, and has often thwarted that nation's ambitions to rule Faerun. Little pleases a Rashemi warrior more than the chance to strike down a Red Wizard in battle.";
  case REGION_SEMBIA:
    return "Following a period of subjugation at the hands of Netheril, Sembia is already on its way to becoming the economic power it was in prior years. Although relations are cool with the Dales and Cormyr following the most recent war, Sembian merchants are quick to dismiss previous conflicts as the work of the Netherese, and remind their former trading partners of the long and mutually profitable relationships they previously enjoyed. To prove its good intentions, Sembia has 'allowed' Featherdale and Tasseldale to regain their independence, even though Sembian investors had owned much of Featherdale for nearly seventy years when the war came to an end.\r\n\r\n"
           "Before Netheril claimed Sembia as a vassal state, mercenary work and adventuring were popular livelihoods among Sembians who didn't have local families to feed. Those endeavors are even more popular now among veterans of the war, who are better trained than their predecessors were. A few of Sembia's less scrupulous former soldiers have taken to banditry, which offers other Sembians more opportunities for guard work.";
  case REGION_THAY:
    return "For centuries one of the greatest concentrations of magical might in Faerun, Thay is ruled by the ancient lich, Szass Tam, and the nation's Council of Zulkirs in a ruthless magocracy. The council's will is enacted by regional tharchions and bureaucrats, leaving the ruling Red Wizards to focus on magical study and more important arcane matters.\r\n\r\n"
           "For a time, living mages couldn't hope to advance to prominence in Thay: Szass Tam promoted undeath as a means of existence with boundless possibilities, and held back those who didn't agree with this philosophy. The recent battles with the demon Eltab, however, have prompted Szass Tam to loosen this stricture - the living now have hope of ascending within the Red Wizards, even if that hope is merely to advance to a high station within the cadre of Tam's servants.";
  case REGION_THESK:
    return "Reminders of the century-old war with the Tuigan horde remain throughout Thesk, in the many and varied features of its present-day inhabitants, particularly the half-orc descendants of the mercenaries who fought in that great conflict.\r\n\r\n"
           "Thesk is known to many as the Gateway to the East because it is the western terminus of the Golden Way, which runs through the Hordelands and into Kara-Tur. Because their city is a crossroads of sorts between Faerun and the east, it should come as no surprise that Theskians don't judge outsiders quickly, and don't bristle at visitors who demonstrate strange quirks in speech or behavior. The people of Thesk trade readily with any folk, even nearby orcs and goblins that are willing to treat with them peacefully. They aren't fools, however, and have no patience for violent or raiding humanoids of all sorts.";
  case REGION_TURMISH:
    return "On the southern shore of the Sea of Fallen Stars, Turmish is a nation of mercantile cities ruled by its Assembly of Stars, representatives of each of its cities in a parliamentary democracy. After being much diminished by the devastation wrought in this area a century ago, Turmish is currently enjoying a revival of its fortunes, as the rising of the waters of the Inner Sea has returned some of the trade that was lost in the cataclysm. Turmish is the birthplace of the Emerald Enclave, which has proudly taken credit for the rebirth of Turmishan agriculture, the cessation of the great rains that plagued the region a few years ago, and the restoration of the god Lathander.";
  case REGION_TYMANTHER:
    return "In decades past, the land of the dragonborn claimed as its territory part of what had been the vanished nation of Unther. Then Unther suddenly returned to Faerun a few years ago and promptly went to war against Tymanther. The realm has since been reduced to small tracts mainly along the coast of the Alamber Sea and Ash Lake. The dragonborn that have withdrawn to those areas have lost none of their military tradition, and their ability to hold this smaller amount of territory makes it unlikely that Unther will push farther any time soon - particularly since the Untherite navy has been unable to overcome the great beast that guards the harbor of Djerad Kethendi and the nearby waters of the Alamber.\r\n\r\n"
           "Some of Tymanther's dragonborn have spread across Faerun and gained reputations as competent, highly sought-after mercenaries.";
  case REGION_UNTHER:
    return "Trapped in another world, the people of Unther had succumbed to domination by others. Then among them arose one who called himself Gilgeam, and he reminded them of their former greatness. Under the leadership of this reincarnated god, the people of Unther rose up as an army to face their masters. On the eve of a great battle, the people of Unther were miraculously returned to their home, and Gilgeam wasted no time in leading them against the dragonborn occupying their ancestral lands. The Untherites have retaken much of the land they formerly held, while seeking to wipe out the 'godless lizards' they blame for their time of oppression in Abeir.\r\n\r\n"
           "Gilgeam wants nothing short of a complete return to Unther's former glory. This achievement will require utterly destroying Tymanther, of course, and eventual war with Mulhorand to reclaim lands lost centuries ago, but as every Untherite knows, the great God-King is patient, for he is eternal.";
  case REGION_WESTGATE:
    return "The dismal city of Westgate isn't a romantic place, but someone seeking employment for shady work, or looking to hire someone for the same, will find few places better suited in all of Faerun.\r\n\r\n"
           "Westgate is considered by some Faerunians as a harbinger of the eventual fate of places like Amn and Sembia, where coin rules over all other considerations. As in many such places, one's moral outlook is less important in Westgate than one's attitude toward bribery. The city's proximity to Cormyr makes it a breeding ground for that nation's enemies, including the Fire Knives, a guild of thieves and assassins that the naive pretend doesn't exist.";
  case REGION_KARA_TUR:
    return "Far to the east, past the wastes of the Hordelands, lie the empires of Shou Lung, Kozakura, Wa, and the other lands of the vast continent of Kara-Tur. To most people of Faerun, Kara-Tur is like another world, and the tales told by travelers from its nations seem to confirm it. The gods that humans worship in Faerun are unknown there, as are common peoples such as gnomes and orcs. Other dragons, neither chromatic nor metallic, dwell in its lands and fly its skies. And its mages practice forms of magic mysterious even to archwizards of Faerun.\r\n\r\n"
           "Stories of Kara-Tur tell of gold and jade in great abundance, rich spices, silks, and other goods rare or unknown in western lands - alongside tales of shapechanging spirit-people, horned giants, and nightmare monsters absent in Faerun.";
  case REGION_ZAKHARA:
    return "Far to the south of Faerun, beyond Calimshan and even the jungles of Chult, are the Lands of Fate. Surrounded by waters thick with pirates and corsairs, Zakhara is a place less hospitable than most, but still braved by travelers who hope to profit from its exotic goods and strange magics. Like Kara-Tur, Zakhara seems a world away to Faerunians. It is thought of as a vast desert, sprinkled with glittering cities like scattered gems. Romantic tales abound of scimitar-wielding rogues riding flying carpets and of genies bound in service to humans. Their mages, called sha'ir, practice their magic with the aid of genies and, it is said, might carry the lineage of these elemental beings in their blood.\r\n";
  case REGION_ICEWIND_DALE:
    return "Icewind Dale is an arctic tundra located in the Frozenfar region of the North, known for being the northernmost explored region in all of Faerun. It earned its name from the harsh winds and icy storms that destroyed buildings and scoured the landscape.\r\n\r\n"
           "The dale is a harsh, near-uninhabitable land that regularly plunges below freezing temperatures, and receives little sunlight, particularly during the severe winter months. It is home to only the most hardened of frontiersmen, pioneers, and barbarians. Beyond the sporadic dots of civilization dwelled terrifying beasts and deadly monsters of the North.";
  case REGION_THE_SWORD_COAST:
    return "The Sword Coast is a region on the northwestern coast of Faerun. While it comprises a rough landscape of rugged hills, precarious mountain ranges and dense forests, it is home to several like-minded towns and cities. The most prominent of these cities banded together with nearby allies to form the Lords' Alliance, which unites much of the region.\r\n\r\n"
           "This vast region of the North stretches all the way from the Spine of the World in the north, south to the great metropolis of Waterdeep. It is bordered on the west by the coastland of the Sea of Swords and along the east by the Long Road.";
  case REGION_LURUAR:
    return "Luruar, also commonly known as the Silver Marches, is a confederation of cities in the north of Faerun, under the leadership of Alustriel Silverhand, former ruler of Silverymoon. It consists of Silverymoon, Citadel Adbar, Deadsnows, Jalanthar, Quaervarr, Citadel Felbarr, Everlund, Mithral Hall, and Sundabar, and its goal is to protect the North against the growing horde of orcs in the mountains. The nation is also a member of the Lords' Alliance.\r\n"
           "It was bordered by the Anauroch desert to the east, the High Forest to the south, the Savage Frontier to the west and the Spine of the World mountain range to the north. It also shares a border with the kingdom of Many-Arrows.";
  case REGION_EVERMEET:
    return "The island nation Evermeet, occasionally known as the Green Isle, is the last true kingdom of, and the final destination for all non-drow Tel'Quessir ('elves') on Faerun. Very few non-elves have ever been permitted to visit.\r\n"
           "Much of Evermeet's architecture is created by magical means, most notably by the use of the spell construction.\r\n\r\n"
           "The north of the island is made up of rugged terrain with steep headlands and covered in dark pine forest.\r\n\r\n"
           "The eastern shore is heavily forested with oaks and evergreen right up to the calm, deep blue waters of the sea.";
  case REGION_THE_SAVAGE_FRONTIER:
    return "The Savage Frontier is the region of northwest Faerun north of the Delimbiyr River, excluding the Sword Coast North, the High Forest and the nation of Luruar, also known as the Silver Marches. In contrast to the civilized cities found to the south and west, the Savage Frontier comprises rural farmsteads and rough settlements of miners and loggers.\r\n\r\n"
           "It is a temperate land, with rugged landscape that is rich with natural resources.";
  case REGION_ANAUROCH_DESERT:
    return "Anauroch, or The Great Sand Sea, is a magical desert in northern Faerun. It holds the remnants of the once-powerful Netherese Empire, their flying enclaves having crashed to the ground when their greatest mage Karsus, in a desperate bid to end the war against the phaerimm, challenged the goddess Mystryl for her divine mantle, causing the Weave to falter and all magic to fail. For generations since, Anauroch, the greatest desert in Faerun, encroached relentlessly on border nations, burying them beneath the sands.\r\n\r\n"
           "The returned masters of Anauroch, the ancient Netherese wizards of Thultanthar, warped and twisted by their long exile in the Plane of Shadow, were determined to retake what they considered their birthright, longing to restore the barren wasteland that was Anauroch to the once-fertile land of Netheril. The Shadovar had a regimented society, ruled by Telamont Tanthul and his Princes of Shade, all working in unison, toughened by centuries of hardship in the Plane of Shadow, to accomplish their common goal. They all but ignored the Bedine and Zhentarim, considering them beneath their notice.";
  case REGION_THE_UNDERDARK:
    return "The Underdark is the vast network of underground caverns and tunnels underneath the surface of Toril. It is home to a host of evil beings driven deep into the caverns at the end of the age of demons.\r\n\r\n"
           "The Underdark is not one giant cavern under Faerun, but rather, many huge networks of caverns and caves. As a result, it is not always possible to travel from one end of the Underdark to the other. The Underdark is divided into several domains that were similar to continents of the world above. While it is possible to travel from one place to another within a domain, separate domains tend to have very few passages linking them. The major domains of the Underdark are the Buried Realms, the Darklands, the Deep Wastes, the Earthroot, the Glimmersea, Great Bhaerynden, the Northdark, and Old Shanatar.";
