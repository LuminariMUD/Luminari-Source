echo "2. Implementation Details:"
echo "   ✅ Added parse_json_double_value() function for JSON parsing"
echo "   ✅ Added get_seasonal_weight_for_hint() function"
echo "   ✅ Added get_time_weight_for_hint() function" 
echo "   ✅ Modified load_contextual_hints() to include seasonal_weight, time_of_day_weight columns"
echo "   ✅ Added contextual weight filtering (0.3 minimum threshold)"
echo "   ✅ Added contextual_weight field to region_hint structure"

echo "   - Seasonal weight calculation: get_seasonal_weight_for_hint(json, season)"
echo "   - Time weight calculation: get_time_weight_for_hint(json, time_category)"
echo "   - Combined weight threshold filtering (seasonal_weight * time_weight >= 0.3)"
echo "   - Priority boost from contextual relevance (priority * combined_weight)"

echo "   - SEASON_AUTUMN (2): Sep-Nov"
echo "   - SEASON_WINTER (3): Dec-Feb"
