## Core Dump Analysis Summary for LuminariMUD

### The Crash
- **Signal**: SIGABRT (Signal 6) - The program called `abort()` due to a fatal error
- **Location**: Inside `free()` in the C library, called from `free_tokens()` at mysql.c:243
- **Root Cause**: Memory corruption - attempting to free invalid/garbage memory pointers

### Call Stack (Bottom to Top)
1. MUD boots up (`main()` ‚Üí `init_game()` ‚Üí `boot_db()`)
2. House system initialization (`House_boot()`)
3. Loading house #24828 (`House_load()`)
4. Parsing objects from database (`objsave_parse_objects_db()`)
5. Tokenizing object data with `tokenize()` function
6. Attempting to free tokens with `free_tokens()` - **CRASH HERE**

### The Bug

The `tokenize()` function in mysql.c has a critical bug in how it NULL-terminates the token array:

```c
// Current buggy code (mysql.c lines 215-226):
while (1)
{
    if (count >= capacity)
        result = realloc(result, (capacity *= 2) * sizeof(*result));
    
    result[count++] = tok ? strdup(tok) : tok;  // <-- Adds NULL but increments count
    
    if (!tok)
        break;
    
    tok = strtok(NULL, delim);
}
```

**The Problem**: 
- When `strtok` returns NULL (no more tokens), the code stores NULL at `result[count]` and increments `count`
- Then it breaks from the loop
- The array now has NULL at position `count-1`, but position `count` and beyond contain uninitialized garbage memory

**Why It Crashes**:
- `free_tokens()` expects a NULL-terminated array
- It loops through with `for (it = tokens; *it; ++it)` looking for NULL
- Because the NULL is not at the end of the allocated data, it continues past NULL into garbage memory
- When it tries to `free()` these garbage pointers (like `0x24055380 " R\005$"`), the program crashes

### Evidence from GDB
- `lines` array after tokenize: Valid pointer addresses followed by garbage
- Token values show corrupted data: `" U\005$"`, `"\200R\005$"`, etc. instead of valid strings
- The serialized object data itself was valid (started with `"#3183\nLoc : -1\nFlag:..."`)

### The Fix

Replace the tokenize loop with proper NULL termination:

```c
while (tok)
{
    if (count >= capacity)
        result = realloc(result, (capacity *= 2) * sizeof(*result));
    
    result[count++] = strdup(tok);
    tok = strtok(NULL, delim);
}

// Ensure space for NULL terminator and add it
if (count >= capacity)
    result = realloc(result, (capacity + 1) * sizeof(*result));
result[count] = NULL;
```

This ensures the array is properly NULL-terminated without garbage values after the NULL.

### Additional Notes
- This bug only manifests when loading house data (not player data)
- The crash happens during boot when loading house #24828
- The bug is deterministic - it will crash every time at the same place until fixed

### Memory Leaks and Issues (From Valgrind Analysis - July 24, 2025)

Log file for reference if needed: valgrind_20250724_221634.md

#### Critical Memory Leaks (460KB total definitely lost)
| ‚òê | Location | Issue | Size | Priority |
|---|----------|-------|------|----------|
| ‚òë | hlquest.c:768, 769 | clear_hlquest() strdup without free | 113KB total | CRITICAL |
| ‚òë | hlquest.c:925 | boot_the_quests() calloc without free | 15.7KB | HIGH |
| ‚úÖ | mysql.c:211, 218 | tokenize() malloc/realloc leaks | 318KB total | CRITICAL |
| ‚òê | db.c:4021 | read_object() object creation leaks | ~7KB | MEDIUM |
| ‚òê | db.c:4004 | read_object() larger object leaks | 2.4KB | MEDIUM |
| ‚òê | dg_variables.c:65 | Script variable memory not freed | Multiple small | LOW |
| ‚òê | handler.c:134 | isname() strdup temporary strings not freed | Multiple 6-7 bytes | MEDIUM |
| ‚òê | spell_parser.c:3055 | spello() spell name strings not freed | 38-39 bytes each | MEDIUM |
| ‚òê | dg_scripts.c:2990,2996 | script_driver() temp data during triggers | Various | MEDIUM |
| ‚òê | db.c:4311,4385 | Object strings during zone resets not freed | Various | MEDIUM |

#### Uninitialized Values
| ‚òê | Location | Issue | Errors | Priority |
|---|----------|-------|--------|----------|
| ‚òê | db.c:4937, 4939 | fread_clean_string() uninitialized stack vars | 60 errors | MEDIUM |

#### Use-After-Free
| ‚òê | Location | Issue | Details | Priority |
|---|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| ‚òê | lists.c/mud_event.c | Accessing freed event memory | 8 bytes inside freed block | HIGH |
| ‚úÖ | comm.c:2951 | close_socket() accessing freed descriptor | Segfault during cleanup | CRITICAL |

**Details**:
- **hlquest.c**: Major leaks in quest system - clear_hlquest() allocates strings with strdup (lines 768, 769) but never frees them. Called from boot_the_quests() at lines 901 and 914. Total: 9,840 + 10,496 + 44,970 + 47,952 = 113,258 bytes lost.
- **mysql.c**: tokenize() function has severe memory leaks from malloc (line 211) and realloc (line 218) operations. Affects load_paths() and other database operations. Total: ~318KB lost.
- **db.c:4937**: fread_clean_string() has uninitialized stack variables causing 60 conditional jump errors. Affects IBT file loading.
- **handler.c:134**: isname() creates temporary strings with strdup during name parsing that are never freed. Common in movement/equipment commands.
- **spell_parser.c:3055**: spello() allocates spell name strings that persist for the entire runtime without cleanup.
- **dg_scripts.c**: script_driver() at lines 2990/2996 leaks temporary data during trigger execution, especially through load_mtrigger and reset_wtrigger.
- **Zone resets**: Objects loaded during zone resets (db.c:4311,4385) allocate strings that aren't tracked for cleanup.
- **Use-after-free**: Event system accessing memory 8 bytes inside a 24-byte block that was freed by free_mud_event().
- **close_socket**: Critical use-after-free at comm.c:2951 accessing descriptor data after freeing, causing segfaults.
